Unfortunately his writings were so copious and obscured under the cloak of pseudonyms that many people give up before they begin to mine the riches of his work.  Moore has finally provided an accessible distillation of his work in this topical compilation.  There are 98 topics (e.g. doubt, love, faith/reason, despair, risk, passion...) which either contain single, important passages or a series of quotes from various works.  I often found myself laughing out loud.<br /><br /> Unlike many Kierkegaard scholars who insist on anachronistically viewing him through his twentieth century French interpreters, Moore has a sense for passions, wit and contributions of the Danish philosopher.  A caution: SK out of context can often be misinterpreted since he usually speaks in a voice not his own, intended to incite passionate response.  However, I would still highly recommend it to anyone who has either a deep interest or a passing curiosity in Kierkegaard or a passionate, authentic life of action in general.<br /><br />(Note: the text of this is also available in a free, searchable pdf on-line)."	2005-10-08

The inexorable and seemingly invincible oppression took root during Stalin's reign and remained in place in one form or another through the beginning of Gorbachev's glasnost campaign.  Yet dissent was not silenced entirely.  Throughout the Soviet era a small band of individuals, mostly acting individually or in very loose coalitions, did not submit.  It is clear that dissidents such as A.I. Solzhenitsyn, Anatoly Scharansky, and Roy Medvedev caused the Soviet regime no small amount of concern.  But as set out in \\"The KGB File of Andrei Sakharov\\" no one caused more aggravation to the Soviet authorities than Andrei Sakharov.<br /><br />The editors Joshua Rubenstein and Alexander Gribanov have done an excellent job of putting the files in perspective.  The book begins with a brief political biography by Rubenstein of the life of Sakharov and on the history of dissent in the USSR.  Rubenstein, a director at Amnesty International has been involved in Soviet affairs for years and his deep knowledge of the subject matter shows through.  The biographical introduction is concise but provides sufficient background information for the documents that follow.  (I recommend Richard Lourie's \\"Sakharov a Biography\\" and Sakharov's \\"Memoirs\\" but Rubenstein's introduction is sufficient.)<br /><br />Sakharov was the Soviet scientist primarily responsible for the development of the Soviet's H-bomb.  He was a hero of the Soviet Union and had almost unlimited, direct access to the Soviet leadership. But Sakharov grew distant from the regime. He refused membership in the Communist Party and began to take up the cause of fellow scientists who had been unfairly dismissed.  As Sakharov dissent evolved the regime grew increasingly intolerant of Sakharov's actions. Sakharov went from focusing on small issues to issues of internal democracy and global peace.  It is clear that if Sakharov did not possess a vast array of nuclear secrets he would have been subject to the exile in the same manner as Alexandr Solzhenitsyn. At the same time, Sakharov was awarded the Nobel Peace Price. The Soviet authorities treated the award as part of a capitalist conspiracy to discredit it. Eventually, the authorities exiled Sakharov and his wife to the closed city of Gorky. There he was harassed and harried on a daily basis by the KGB and its agents.<br /><br />The Sakharov files are sorted into five sections.  They follow the trajectory of Sakharov's involvement in the dissident movement, through his exile to Gorky, and his return from internal exile and untimely death.  Most of the files consist of memos and status reports from the KGB to the Central Committee of the Communist Party.  Most of the reports were written by Yuri Andropov in his capacity as Chairman of the KGB.<br /><br />The documents are chilling on many levels.  The writing is banal at best.  One expects dull bureaucratic prose from low level bureaucrats but I expected more from the Chairman of the KGB. Andropov did have various insights along the way but it almost seems accidental.  Second, we see evidence of the type of cheap bullying that one see in B-gangster movies from the 1950s.  In one memo Andropov notes that Sakharov takes walks in the woods and notes that \\"during these excursions, unexpected occurrences, accidents, etc. can happen and . . . [it would be wise] to speak to Sakharov and point out to him the undesirability of doing things that might jeopardize his health.\\"<br /><br />Despite all the cheap threats, the intimidation, and the deprivation, Sakharov won his fight.  Shortly after Gorbachev came to power Sakharov and Bonner returned to Moscow.  At the time of his death Sakharov had emerged as the leading opposition figure in the fight over the new Soviet constitution that eventually ended the Communist Party's monopoly on political power.  The Soviet Union died shortly after Sakharov did.<br /><br />It is easy in the west to minimize the impact dissidents such as Andrei Sakharov had on the Soviet regime.  However, as Rubenstein points out in his Introduction, former Ambassador to the U.S. Anatoly Dobrynin acknowledged that the dissidents \\"caused considerable damage not only at home, but also to our relations with the rest of the world.\\"  When asked how this was possible another dissident, Andrei Amalrik made the point eloquently: \\"In an unfree country they behaved like free men, thereby changing the moral atmosphere and the nation's governing traditions.\\"<br /><br />Andrei Sakharov walked free in an unfree land and in so doing confound the Soviet authorities.  Rubenstein and Gribanov's \\"The KGB Files of Andrei Sakharov\\" is an excellent place to examine Sakharov's life as seen through the eyes of those who tried unsuccessfully to have him revert to submission."	2005-10-01

You don't have to have grown up in New York or spent summers in the Hamptons to remember the experiences and feelings that come back so vividly reading \Summer in Sea Shell Harbor\\".  Wherever your're from, growing up takes you on an emotional roller coaster that drags you on at around age 13 or 14 and drops you off sometime later, maybe 19 or 20, somewhat beat-up and bruised, but relieved to still be standing.  Whatever else adolescence is, it is a time of intense feelings and fragile egos;  friends are at the center of our lives; good times and bad times; trying to sort through it all and figure things out.  Richard Dunne has done a great job nudging our memories, taking us along with these very real characters who are a lot like our friends growing up; and their predicaments are similar to ones we can recall.  A great read on a universal theme and one that we don't really ever forget.  A book for all ages!  An excellent, enjoyable read."	2005-09-18

Spied it quite by chance whilst browsing through a shop the other day with its catchy cover, bought it, sat down and read in two sessions. Quite a remarkable first novel. <br />Robert Carter's The Language of Stones is set in an alternative fifteenth century  England. One where a thirteen year old lad named Willard has his world rudely turned upside down on Beltine when a gandalf-esque character looms out of the darkness to claim his protege. This sorceror/warlock/wizard (Will is not sure what he is) goes by a multitude of names down the generations but is recognisable under more familiar pseudonyms as Jack O'Lantern or Merlyn , though know n throughout the novel Gwydion. The legend of King Arthur is reborn. <br />A forced march to the Wychwood dumps poor Will in the hands of Lord Strange with his boar's head for six months where the rebellious streak in the lad means he learns some mild naming magic and promptly nearly gets killed by a marsh hag whilst waiting for Willow, a girl of equal age that he has confused feelings for. Just in time Merlyn reappears to take Will with him as the land prepares for a coming war. A trip to meet King Hal and a last minute escape from the overly boorish Duke Edgar lands Will and Gwydion off the Irish coast whence they learn what they must do. Namely discover the battlestones that sit on the lorc lines. What follows is a coming of age for Will as he continues to prove his inheritance before ending up at Fotheringham castle under the guardianship of Duke Richard, pretender to the throne, training as a squire to the overly thuggish firstborn, Edward. Schroolroom fights and taunting later he finds himself grown to a young man, learning from the Wortmaster and struggling to deal with his feelings for Willow who has reappeared. <br />Gywdion returns and has fallen out of favour with the Duke after passing the exquisite diamond they found at Leir's tomb to Queen Mag. War is coming and he takes Will in a desperate attempt to locate the Doomstone, that evil-harbouring piece of granite that is driving the Realm towards War. After finding the lesser Plague stone and discovering more about his inner self Gwydion and Will find themselves at Badon Hill as Duke Richard prepares to assault the town harbouring King Hal, Duke Edgar and the Queen. A short nasty fight finds many prophecies fulfilled and Will has his own sorcerous battle at the heart of the Sightless Ones with the Doomstone cover of St Swythyn's tomb before returning to his own Shire will he enemies defeated but not vanquished. <br />What is sparkling about Carter is that here is clearly an author well versed in English and Celtic myth as he transcribes many names, places and myths into his own versions that are immediately recognisable to the knowledgeable reader. His finest effort is Gwydion's reference to Iuliu the Seer (or Julius Caesar to the historian) but the novel is littered with altered names and celtic mythology that seeks to demonstrate how easy it is to twist the facts by word of mouth. The lengthy author's note at the end goes into some detail about the parallels he draws with British geography and the times that preclude the Wars of the Roses. Carter is a fine author and the sequel to this opener is one novel I'll definitely be shelling out the extra for the hardback version as soon as it is out in May. <br />	2005-09-01

An enjoyable adaptation of Sense and Sensibility, sort of in the vein of Clueless but without the sparkling wit.  It is very predictable, especially for anyone who is familiar with Jane Austen's original work.  Georgie is a nice addition to the story--though she could be traced to Margaret in Emma Thompson's adaption, same tomboy zeal for life.<br /><br />Some characters' motiviations aren't very clear to me either, such as Lucy--who is a bit more sterotypical than the original Lucy Steele. Standard nasty blond girl who somehow is the most popular.<br /><br />It also seems that the story contains a bit of an Emma plot line with Abby and her friend (who's name i can't remember--and I only read it yesterday) vying for the same drummer.<br /><br />All in all, it was aptly compared to a teen beach read.  The girls are cute, and the story is enjoyable in its fluffiness but not the timeless classic from which it has been clearly taken.	2005-09-01

An invalid feels out of place in Oran because it is a place of business, of commerce.  One day Dr. Bernard Rieux feels something soft underfoot.  Townspeople show uneasiness.  Rats are coming out to die. Jean Tarrou is a visitor.  He find the town ugly.  Tarrou's diary entries describe a curious fever that is overcoming some of the occupants of the town.  An older colleague, Castel, tells Rieux that the fever is the plague.  Plagues and wars take people by surprise.<br /><br />Pursuant to Rieux's urging, a health committee convenes at the Prefect's office.  Disease is spreading rapidly.  Rieux has a dazed feeling.  He comes to realize he is afraid.  Instructions are received to declare a state of plague and close the town.  It is hard to grasp what is happening.  Measures are taken regarding traffic and food supply.  Rieux is reproached by a journalist, who is looking for a way to get out of town to be reunited with a lover, that he lives in a world of abstractions.  After a time he does not have to steel himself to not feel pity because he grows out of pity during the crisis of the epidemic.<br /><br />A Week of Prayer is organized in Oran.  A priest gives a sermon that if the plague is present, the hour has come for taking thought.  The town itself is under a sort of incarceration.  Some people adapt to the state of affairs and others do not.  Realizing their peril, people give their thoughts to pleasure.  Tarrou approaches Rieux.  He wants to develop a plan for voluntary assistance in coping with the plague.  Tarrou says his job in life is giving people chances.  Rieux finds the only way of fighting the plague is common decency.<br /><br />By August it seems the plague has eliminated free choice by swallowing up everyone and everything.  There is a sense of exile and deprivation.  The striking feature of the funerals is the speed.  In the end men and women are placed in death pits indiscriminately.  When there is no longer romm for burial the victims go to a fiery end.  The real plague has nothing in common with grandiose imaginings.  The people of Oran develop a habit of despair.  Through September and October there is nothing to do but mark time.  Rieux is exhausted and has no emotional resources.<br /><br />Tarrou's father was a lawyer, a functionary of the legal system.  Tarrou assists in the sanitation work of the plague outbreak because he opposes the death penalty.  In winter some of the patients survive the plague.  Others are helped by a serum.

And since the links are messed up, I can't load a review of Legends Volume 3 where it belongs, WITH Volume 3. So I'm going to review that at the bottom of this one. So this review is actually for parts 2 AND 3 of the Legends anthology.<br /><br />Legends Volume 2--<br />New Spring by Robert Jordan<br /><br />This was very hard to follow for new readers of the Wheel of Time series.<br /><br />The gist seems to be that a great hero/leader, The Dragon, has been reborn and there are many who want to find him for different reasons. The evil Black Aja sisters want to destroy him and are going around murdering anyone young man they think may be the dragon. The rest of the Aja, and their allies, are looking for him to protect him and aid him in learning his abilities.<br /><br />At least I think that is what it was about, and I listened more then once. I did grasp the idea of the Dragon and I understood there are different sects of the Aja, defined by their color. What the difference between them is I have no idea. I can only assume that is explained in the full length novels in the series.<br /><br />The Sea and Little Fishes by Terry Pratchett<br /><br />It is the time for the annual town fair, of which the favorite event is the witch competition. Granny Weatherwax has always one and this year people don't want her to participate. At the same time, Granny decides to go on a \\"friendly\\" binge, at the advice of her friend Nanny Og. But her attempts to be friendly backfire when everyone assumes she's only doing that to try and cause trouble.<br /><br />I liked this story, even not having read anything else by this author. I especially loved Granny, in spite of her gruff and less then friendly attitude. She rang true to me, probably because everyone can think of at least one grumpy elderly person they know. Even though she is not the nicest of people, readers know there is more to her then meets the eye or else Nanny would not be friends with her.<br /><br />The Grinning Man by Orson Scott Card<br /><br />Alvin Maker and his young companion are passing through when they come across a young man, Davey Crockett grinning down a grizzly bear. it turns out the bear wins the match and that means Crockett becomes his \\"pet.\\" So they travel around and bump in to Alvin again in a small village with a crook for a miller.<br /><br />This story was somewhat corny, but amusing. Alvin seems like an intriguing fellow and will make readers want to know more about him, possibly reading other books in the series by this author. I especially liked the entirely different perspective given in to the person of Davy Crockett, and loved the idea of his relationship to the bear.<br /><br />Legends Volume 3--<br />Debt of Bones by Terry Goodkind<br /><br />A young woman goes to the high wizard of her land in order to seek his aid in rescuing her family from the rival land. She calls the wizard on a \\"Debt of Bones\\" between her mother and his father when he refuses, only to find that after he grudgingly agrees, this debt is not what she expected at all.<br /><br />Interesting story that I enjoyed and was fairly easy to follow. There are a couple twists in the story to shock readers. I enjoyed visiting this world and would not be opposed to a future visit.<br /><br />Dragonfly by Ursula K Le Guin<br /><br />A young girl who desires to be trained in the ways of the wizards heads off on a journey with a former student of the wizards, in the hopes she can convince the wizards to break with tradition of only teaching boys, so she can learn magic. When she gets there, nothing goes as she hoped and she discovers a shocking secret about her lineage.<br /><br />Not a bad story but confusing in many parts. Also, this author desperately needs a better editor as she's extremely repetitive and has a tendency to overuse words and phrases to the point it gets very annoying. It also gives a good glimpse in to the \\"politics\\" of the Earthsea world and how women are valued and thought of there.<br /><br />The Burning Man by Tad Williams<br /><br />To be honest I had no clue what this story was about. Something about a man who appears in fire but I couldn't even quite figure out why he appeared. I tried listening to this story a couple times and could not get in to it at all and had no clue what was happening. I finally gave up.<br /><br />I tried to listen to this one three times and could not grasp it at all. this could be due to the fact I like to listen to books when driving so occasionally I miss things, but with almoste very other book I've \\"read\\" this way, I always come away with far more understanding of what happened and why then I did of this story.<br /><br />If readers have not tried Tad Williams' works before, this is not the story with which to start.

Indeed, his argument is that the politicization of the scientific research process is bad no matter which party does it, but that the Bush Administration and the current incarnation of the Republican Party is particularly culpable of abusing science for partisan gain.

"Indeed, All We Are Saying:  The Last Interview with John Lennon and Yoko Ono pulls out the punches.  The book shows how far  former Beatle, John Lennon, had come and where he was headed.  David Sheff's \\"Playboy\\" interview with John Lennon and Yoko Ono is the most fascinating piece of oral history about Lennon's life as well as the story behind every Beatle song.  Sheff intimately takes reader through the studio, John and Yoko's Dakota apartment, and down the neighborhood coffeeshop sharing a cappuccino.  All We Are Saying presents an extremely candid and frank interview that was held two months prior to Lennon's passing.  Sheff reveals Lennon's growth and new beginning that would unfortunately be cut short.<br /><br />All We Are Saying does not lack in humor and seriousness.  This was the man, not the Sixties icon who sang against a \\"Revolution,\\" who still had dreams and aspirations to accomplish at the time the interview was conducted. For fans of Lennon as well as the Beatles, this was Lennon stripped down and open for questions, and he merely tells it like it is or was.  He expresses the breakup of the Beatles, and emphasizes that they were great, but they were in the past.  He talks about the ups and downs of his individual experience from being a heroin addict to a househusband.  He was living in the here and now, and the music that he was making at the time reflected that mantra.  Though the references he made about the music scene now appear dated, Lennon was ahead of his game and kept up with bands, such as the Clash, Pretenders, and the B-52's.  He even raves how the B-52's rip-off Yoko's style of music.<br /><br />Sheff writes the interview in clear and picturesque narrative.  For every new chapter, he introduces the reader to where the interview is going.  However, the concluding portions of the book appear too rushed.  Sheff appears to have wanted to discuss or at least learn about every tidbit about each Beatles song, which almost portrayed a to-do list, and at times it appears as if he did not want to run out of tape.

The animals feel safe because they know if problems arise, Blue Eagle with his watchful eye will save the day.  Blue Eagle is strong and quick and doesn't hesitate to send ill-intending creatures packing.  In the book THE BALLAD OF BLUE EAGLE, an array of animals have gotten together for a game of \\"Sneak and Peek\\" (their version of hide and seek) when Clugar the Carnivorous Cougar comes prowling.  The animals must scurry to save themselves and hope Blue Eagle will come to save the day.<br /><br />THE BALLAD OF BLUE EAGLE is an exciting tale about a lively group of animal characters.  Written in rhyme, the book has a fun cadence that will keep even the youngest of readers listening intently.  The story's style is characteristic of a fable, with moral messages about friendship, accepting differences, and avoiding violence wrapped into an engaging tale about a typical day in Pleasant Valley.  The author introduces elements of humor which include witty character names such as Grady the Gopher, Mortimer Mole, and best of all Toby the Turple (a purple turtle).  While the length of the book may be a bit much for young readers to absorb in one sitting, the author has included chapter breaks, providing logical points to stop and resume the story later.  In addition, the story's suspense will leave youngsters eager to return to this book.  With vivacious illustrations and a well-written story that is just plain enjoyable, THE BALLAD OF BLUE EAGLE is a sure winner, and I hope to see these wonderful characters again in future works.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<br /><br />of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"	2005-08-31

Once I started questioning why I was keeping stuff, I had the strength to let it go and not feel bad about it.  I haven't looked back since.<br /><br />After re-reading this book, it strengthened my resolve to keep clutter out of my life as best I can.  Her reasoning is based on common sense, really, not \\"real\\" Feng Shui: If your friends do nothing but drag you down, time to move on.  If those letters from an old flame hold nothing but bad memories, what's the point in torturing yourself by keeping them?  If you haven't worn that outfit yet, what makes you think you'll wear it sometime this year (even though you've been promising yourself you're going to lose weight to get back into those jeans for years)?<br /><br />Karen also gives advice on how to reduce the chance of re-introducing clutter into your life by questioning the purpose of every single piece of paper you have.  Through reading her book, I have become conscientious of clearing out every so often and I find myself, indeed, questioning every paper that I intend to keep (and many papers hit the recycle bin because of that!).  Same thing for clothes: If they don't fit, bundle them up and give them to people who can use them.<br /><br />Her book also enabled me to let go of many books, tapes, CDs, and DVDs that I have owned for nearly 10 years (along with making it easier to donate clothes that have outlived their usefulness).

"One of the more unique novels to come out of the literary underground is Richard Perez's \\"Losers' Club,\\" a captivating little novel about love, writing, clubs, and New York in the mid-90s. Gritty and edgy, it's also darkly funny (even hilarious). And in a peculiar way, very sweet and romantic.<br /><br />Martin Sierra is a lonely aspiring writer in a dull, uninspiring job. He's searching for a woman he can talk to, a friend as well as a lover. And he has met that woman -- and she is Nikki, a bisexual gal struggling through the end of a dying lesbian relationship. They hang around the glittering clubs and bars of New York's nightlife, perfectly in sync, except for Nikki's lingering sense of guilt that she shouldn't be growing so close to Marty.<br /><br />Marty's addiction to the personal ads reaps a pair of promising responses: Lola, full of rage and anger, and with a disturbing personal life; and Amaris, a gothic \\"creature of the night\\" with morbid interests (she once let a vampire gal suck her bleeding finger), and who has flings with the students she teaches. Martin's professional and personal life takes several strange twists, leading him to where he should have gone all along.<br /><br />The New York of \\"Losers' Club\\" is a stained semiprecious stone. A superficial glittering mass of bars and clubs, full of people who expect no more from it. The inhabitants are all at least a little loserish, but intriguingly so (say what you will about Amaris, she ain't boring!). Transsexuals, goths and vampires, angry artists, frustrated writers, guys on eighteen-inch-glow-in-the-dark platform shoes, and some people who just like to hang out and watch Andy Warhol flicks. Despite the downbeat title, this is a genuinely funny, witty book (the most hilarious part is the collection of ad replies that poor Marty wades through -- some stupid, some discouraging, and some that are just creepy).<br /><br />The newly restored edition is radically different from the original, however -- large chunks have been put back into the narrative, which takes away the stripped-down feel. But it gives it better flow and more insight into the characters, and in the end it's worth sacrificing the \\"minimalist\\" style. There's also some extras at the back: a book discussion club guide (\\"In what ways might the main character be perceived as a 'loser'?\\"), some related writings, and an intelligent interview with Perez sprinkled with literary references.<br /><br />Perez's writing and study of his characters is reminiscent of 80s writers like Jay McInerney (except sprinkled with some very nice poetry). Maybe Dave Sedaris on acid. But he's not so busy appealing to readers' sense of cool that he forgets to keep them emotionally involved. Flashbacks reveal Marty's past with his mentally-ill, abusive mother, whom he harbors a sort of sadness for. Little flashes of dialogue reveal a lot about the characters' souls, and what kind of people they are. (Like whether they believe in fate, or talk to tombstones.)<br /><br />It's hard not to like Marty. He aspires for something like happiness, and seems unable to reach it. But he is the sort who'll find it eventually. Nikki is a good balance of the realistic and idealistic -- while Marty sees her as all but perfect, we see she has doubts and insecurities too. Lola and Amaris are, in a way, enigmas -- we only see hints of what they're really like, and we learn about them as Marty does.<br /><br />\\"The Losers' Club\\" leaves the reader with a sense of bittersweetness.

I was afraid Ellis was trying to and about to succeed out Austering Paul Auster (that isn't a compliment in my world).  Then, around page 150, it hit me.  This is an incredibly good book.  In fact, it may just go on the short list of absolute, must-take-to-desert-island favorites.   <br /> <br />     For those who love Ellis's wry depiction of violence and lack of sentimentality, this might not be a favorite.  It's a huge departure from the usual Ellis themes - a morally flat society where violence, drug use, sex and any social taboo you can name is just another fashion.  Here, the world isn't morally flat.  Everything does have consequences, but not in the Dr. Phil sense he seems to be parodying here.   <br /> <br />       This is also more of a writer's novel than his previous works.  He definitely wrestles with the issues of what a writer creates; beyond that, he also seems to be addressing more difficult ideas such as Auden's idea that (to paraphrase) we choose our own traumas.  In that sense, and in the Stephen King sense, it is a horror and one that resonates.   <br />To anyone looking for a haunting, more mature story I would recommend this and recommend sticking with it through the bombastic first section.  As obnoxious as it can be, at the end it makes sense and it is the first time I've seen Ellis develop a character.  The posturing, blas enfant terrible Bret Easton Ellis in the first section is very different from the father who ends the novel and how Ellis moves the story between those points is entirely striking. <br />	2005-09-01

"This is a very comprehensive book and goes into a lot of detail, and surprisingly gives a fair anaylsis of some Watchtower books and rating them on a 5-star rating system. <br /> <br />Anylyzes fairly and critquely but doesn't come to any conclusions! The title is misleading because one is lead to believe the authour is pro divine name in Greek Scripture as well as Hebrew Scripture. This person spends far too much time on talking about Hebrew manuscripts from 1385 AD being the only possible manuscript support. The focus should have been on obvious Scriptures in Revelation that says \\"hallelujah,' and Scriptures like in Luke 20:42 where it says NWT 42 For David himself says in the book of Psalms, `Jehovah said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand 43 until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.' Obviously other translations should put \\"Jehovah\\" in as well, which is not the case. <br /> <br />On a comprehensive study on this subject for proof the divine name did exist, try reading Gerard Gertoux's book \\"The name of God Yehowah...\\" which is important to read but unfortunately difficult at times because of French syntax. This book will explain everything that Lynn does not discuss! <br /> <br />Again, it's not completely bad because it has a glossary of terms and gives a detailed list of all the \\"J references\\" from 1385, but generally gives the reader no hope or proof of the divine name in the Greek Scriptures.

Although life can be cumbersome and we often don't have enough time, she urges us to make time.  Preparation, planning and creating an environment conducive for reflection and learning is key.  Additionally, Johnson offers up seven steps which she refers to as the seven P's, to follow as a guide when beginning your own personal Bible Study.  This approach encourages the student to take notes in an outline type of format and apply various learning techniques to comprehend the Bible and apply it to daily living.<br /><br />Although Ms. Johnson's book may not be anything new to even the average Bible student, her explanation of the process, the examples she uses and the flowing manner in which she writes, struck a chord with me.  It reinforced the inductive study approach I had used many years ago, but it also added a new twist with the outline style format.  The method introduced by Ms. Johnson can be applied to your personal study or used with a group as well.<br /><br />Appendix A in the back of the book includes a leader's guide with helpful suggestions for Bible study leaders.  Appendix B includes a wonderful diagram explaining the different translations of the Bible.  Also included in the appendices are a resource guide in which Johnson recommends such tools as commentaries and Bible encyclopedias.  All in all, this book is small but mighty!

Passion becomes a destructive force by the time all is said and done, yet afterwards, a rarity among Hardy stories, a happy ending does emerge. Bathsheba (a fascinating name to pronounce) is caught up in feelings she can't contain, which leads to both the quiet love of Gabriel (who lets nature takes its long silent course) and the future madness of Boldwood, whose own desire virtually ruins him. Throw in the 3rd party distraction of soldier Frank Troy and you have a near soap opera like quadrangle that pretty much determines the fates of all the main characters. You get a strong sense of farming life here- as sales, native farm hands, crops and weather patterns each come into play as every day hurdles and absurdities. Hardy really knows how to make every landscape a looming aspect of all his novels. You can almost inhale the scenery here.	2005-08-31

On the day she arrived in Alexandria, however, her grand adventure became a catastrophe in the making when her unmarried traveling companion, Isabel, confessed her secret pregnancy.  Months later, while traveling down the Nile, Pip prays for a miracle to save her laboring friend.  The miracle arrives in the form of John Henry Lovell, the childhood friend she has not seen in a decade.  When Isabel dies from complications, Pip is determined to raise the baby as her own.  However, the only way to avoid scandal is to marry and Pip now finds herself trapped in a marriage to John Henry.  A man who, in Pip's eyes, has married her to gain social prominence.<br /><br />John Henry had adored Pip for most of his life.  Knowing the difference between their stations, he was a farmer's son and she was the stepdaughter of a marquess and an heiress to boot, he had been prepared to love her from afar.  That is, until one day when harsh words tore them apart.  Ten years later, John Henry is rich and well connected -- a fact he hides from his new bride.  John Henry will now have to work for the one thing he doesn't have...Pip's love.<br /><br />LILIES ON THE LAKE revisits characters we first met in IN THE PRESENCE OF ANGELS.  While the first half is full of action and takes place in exotic locations, it is in the second half of the book that one really begins to empathize with these two characters.  By all accounts, Pip has grown up to be quite an accomplished and independent woman.  However, there remain traces of the spoilt girl who once drove her best friend away.  John Henry has grown up nicely as well, but his desire for Pip's unconditional love drives him to actions that might, in the end, prove disastrous.  Though you might want to knock this pair's heads together every so often, readers will enjoy this tale.<br /><br />TheSchemer	2005-08-31

Because the author is Italian, his book isn't Anglo-centric, Franco-centric, or Germano-centric; all participants are objectively covered without losing the drama of the battle and without the booster-ism and cheerleading of other books.  Like many military history books, however, there are few useful maps, but the terrain and deployments are well described and easy to understand - at least if you have some knowledge of the battle.  Despite this flaw, the author gives a genuinely new and different account of the battle with many insights; the examples are many.  For instance, the Allied infantry deployed in four ranks instead of two in order to facilitate forming square, a clear break from usual practice.  D'Erlon's early afternoon attack was not made in massive columns, as has been thought, but largely in successive lines - probably in reaction to experience in the Peninsula War.  Lobau's corps was initially sent to support D'Erlon after his failed attack, and not to oppose the Prussians as stated in earlier accounts.  In fact, the author shows that Napoleon had not even done the simple reasoning to deduce that the troops approaching him couldn't possibly have been French and could only have been Prussian.  The British cavalry counterattack which reached the Grand Battery had little effect on French artillery, despite claims to the contrary, and in effect destroyed the Allied cavalry.  So when the massive French cavalry attacks occurred, there was little the Allied cavalry could do.  Allied infantry casualties piled up, and had the attacks lasted much longer, the squares would have broken.  So French cavalry dominance and skirmisher superiority, neither of which had been the case in Spain, along with artillery superiority, nearly won the battle for Napoleon despite French errors.  Finally, partly in the hope that their mere appearance would put the Allies to flight, the Imperial Guard was brought forward.  Not of their former quality, the Guard advanced in squares, not columns as has been thought.  It was touch and go for some time, but the Allies held firm, and the French fled in panic.  Throughout the book, the psychological state of the men in the ranks is key to understanding the battle.  In short, this book presents the latest findings on the battle, is well researched, well reasoned, well written, and well worth reading.rench errors.

Vere Aylwin Mallory, the seventh Duke of Ainswood, is a throwback to his family's wilder generations.  Having buried too many loved ones recently, he has sworn to care for no one else and proceeds to live a life of debauchery in London.  Of course, it would take a strong and unique heroine to tame him and Lydia Grenville is all that and more.  Lydia works as a reporter for The Argus, writing about the plight of the lower classes.  From the moment they meet, Lydia confuses, torments, aggravates, and generally drives Vere insane.<br /><br />I was so engrossed in their story that I was determined to stay up last night until I reached the end.  I got to bed after 2am but it was a night well spent.  This is a truly wonderful story of two obstinate people too blind and stubborn to realize that they are falling in love.  An extra bonus is that I got to catch up with characters from previous Loretta Chase books.  Sebastian and Jessica Ballinger from LORD OF SCOUNDRELS are here, as well as Jessie's dimwitted but lovable brother, Bertie Trent.<br /><br />Loretta Chase is a fantastic author who has always delivered the goods.  Once you meet Vere and Lydia you will want to enter Loretta's world.  A world filled with some of the most fascinating characters you'll ever meet between the pages of a book.

"Marseilles kindly remembers the rugby player Daniel Jacquot, though they now know him as Chief Inspector Jacquot, homicide.  It does come in handy to have the people of his home town feel that they own him and his sporting achievements of more than twenty years before.   He must deliver into the hands of the public the killer that the press have dubbed \\"The Waterman\\".  It is not that clever a moniker - the Waterman, after having his way with the victims, leaves the bodies in water.  Forensically, a nightmare, but a challenge for the French homicide team to face. <br />  <br />Paired off with a transfer in from the vice department, Jacquot is keen as always to follow his own instincts and investigate alone.   His very young girlfriend has left him and his apartment, complete with nosey land lady, holds no appeal for him.  Marseilles has its own court of the rich and successful who manipulate the authorities to further their own ventures and it is into this world that Jacquot strays in order to find a connection for his clients, the victims.  A local gym was used by two of the girls and it may be more than just lucky co-incidence that the name of one elite company and its untouchable owners keeps surfacing wherever he looks.  Is it sport, or are these young girls murdered to protect someone or something? <br />  <br />This is a sophisticated read set in a city well known to the author Martin O'Brien, a former travel writer.  Sub plots and individual agendas abound in \\"Jacquot and the Waterman\\" which will take an organized mind to keep nailed down, as they read this fast moving thriller.  The conclusion could feel like a major let down after this investment, forgiven perhaps for the fascinating characters with their glittery city that you have been fondly introduced to along the way.  O'Brien has created in Jacquot a memorable hero in the form of a clever, moody loner, though the fawning descriptions from Jacquot's adoring French public are slapped on a little thick over the course of the book.  This series shows huge promise with it's curiously well rounded homicide detective who doesn't seem to fit any accepted police procedural mould out on the market at present.  A showy and well presented novel that would fall more into the category of thriller than crime novel with its cosmopolitan backdrop and flashy, well-heeled cast. <br />"	2005-08-31

When her father turns up dead, she runs to escape the brutal man, Dougal, who intends her to compel her into marrying him, so he can stake his claim as the clan chief. As hounds are chasing her down, she runs right into the arms of another, possibly even more dangerous man.<br /><br />Symon MacLachlan, known by all as the Devil of Kilmartin, suffers from his own personal demons, being dragged down into the depths of madness. When a mysterious beauty crashes into him in the circle of stones, where his curse first manifested itself, for an all-too brief moment his agony is assuaged by her touch. He rescues her from her pursuer, and takes her with him back to his keep, convinced she is the infamous Lamont healer, though she denies this at every turn.<br /><br />Elena is even more afraid of Symon and his madness then she is of Dougal, but she has no choice other than to go with him for now, and plan to escape as soon as she is able. All her life, people have used her for her gift and she believes Symon intends the same, especially with all his demands that she heal him. She continues to deny the truth, holding back her abilities and posing as a simple herb woman who has some training in healing. Symon knows she can help him and decides the only thing to do is to woo her into assisting him. The last thing either of them expects is the tender feelings that spring up between them, making Elena wish she could stay with him, in the only place she ever truly felt she belonged. Symon finds himself wanting more then just her aid... he wants her heart as well.<br /><br />But Dougal is still on the loose, and has vowed to get Elena back at any cost. He swears he will conquer the MacLachlan clan, once and for all, and snatch back his intended bride, the only person standing in the way of his full rise to power. Elena and Symon have no choice but to trust each other if they are to defeat Dougal finally, but can they do that without risking her secret getting out and his madness overtaking him completely?<br /><br />What an incredible read! Ms. Wittig has shown her very impressive talent in this, her debut novel. The passion between Elena and Symon erupts from the page, making it impossible for one to doubt their feelings for each other, even while they continue to deny it to themselves. All of her characters are full of life and vigor, from Auld Morag to the clan's children.

I had never gotten around to reading it until just recently, when I found it buried amongst some other books.    The book, published in 1963, consists of a number of radio and television plays (Hrspiele und Fernsehspiele). My copy states that it has been translated from Polish into German by Klaus Stmmler, Charlotte Eckert, Jutta Janke and I. Zimmerman-Gllheim.    The radio play that gives the book its title (\\"Mondnacht\\"), is about two men who have been living in a station on the moon. This is a great story about human nature and survival. I was also amazed by the fact that Lem's news of the future included terrorism! In fact, this theme comes up several times in the book.    The second play is \\"Der Forschungsreise des Professors Tarantoga\\" (\\"The research trip of Professor Tarantoga\\"). He has invented a space travel machine that is simply a box on a table. He and his assistant, Chybek, visit other locations in the galaxy and encounter life forms in various stages of development.    One highly developed life form tells him: \\"He, Sie, wissen Sie, mit wem Sie sprechen?

This is the first book I have read by Stanislaw Lem. Despite its age, it is quite entertaining! As I stated above, it is in German, but if you can read German it is great reading.

Luca urges Shannon to marry him, but she knows he isn't motivated by love. For the sake of her orphaned baby niece, Shannon knows she will accept. But what does the future hold when Luca believes-wrongly-that she once betrayed him?<br /><br />Comments:<br /><br />Shannon and Luca are former lovers that are reunited after their siblings tragically die in an accident, leaving behind their niece. Luca still has strong feelings for Shannon, yet is bitter over what he believes caused their relationship to end. Nevertheless, Luca believes that a marriage between him and Shannon is the best solution for their niece. But, the truth as to why they broke up will reveal itself bringing forth issues of trust and betrayal. Though at times I got frustrated with Luca's suspicious mind and his issues with trust, he was not a totally loathsome hero. Shannon had a lot of spunk, but I wish that the BIG misunderstanding could have been resolved earlier. Overall, Shannon and Luca had powerful chemistry together and both endured and showed a lot of powerful emotions.	2005-08-31

Books	4	2	3	False	False	A steamy fantasy	The second installment of Harlequin Temptation's Fantasies, Inc. miniseries takes us to the island of Secret Fantasy...<br /><br />Juliette Stanton just wants to get away from it all.  Tagged Chicago's Runaway Bride by the press for breaking off her wedding to her Senator father's protegee, only Juliette and her former fianc&eacute; know the truth.  All her life, Juliette had been known as the good girl, just as her twin sister, Gillian, was the wild child.  Doing what was expected of her, Juliette became engaged to her childhood friend thinking that years of caring would make a basis for marriage.  When her fianc&eacute;'s business partner was caught laundering mob money, she believed Stuart's denials of involvement.  However, when she catches him meeting with a reputed mob leader just minutes before the ceremony, Juliette realizes that she has been living a lie.  Now, in a carefully planned escape, she is heading to Secret Fantasy to live out her dream -- to experience the luxury of being catered to and doted upon by a very special man...to forget the hurt of a broken engagement.<br /><br />Reporter Doug Houston is desperate.  Hell hath no fury than a woman scorned and Doug's career is in trouble because of it.  His recently ended relationship had involved business and pleasure.  His girlfriend had access to information that proved useful to him in the past, but when he broke up with her, she gave him information on Juliette Stanton's fianc&eacute; which he inexplicably couldn't confirm once the story ran.  Hearing about the aborted wedding makes him think there must be a connection to his story, so now Doug has arranged to be at Secret Fantasy to fulfill the Runaway Bride's dreams while hoping to salvage his own.  Will they get both their fantasies fulfilled?<br /><br />Exotic and steamy, SECRET FANTASY was a joy to read.  It was certainly fun to read Juliette shed her inhibitions and become a sensual creature comfortable in her own skin.  Providing an interesting contrast is Doug's character as he grapples with his goal of salvaging his career and his guilt over hiding his true identity from Juliette.

Martin's better works, 'The Armageddon Rag' still holds it charms for those of us who remember the era it was written in; and written for.  'Rag' was written in the eighties, with a trip down memory lane to the late sixties and early seventies, the birth of heavy rock and the 'freedom era'.<br /><br />Sandy Blair is a writer, working hard on his latest novel that just seems to go nowhere, when he gets a call from his old magazine The Hedgehog to do a piece on the murder of Jamie Lynch, one time manager to the late, great rock band, the Nazgul.  The Nazgul were the biggest band of a lost era, until the lead singer, Patrick Henry Hobbins was shot to death at one of their concerts.<br /><br />Sandy accepts, and takes off on a road trip that leads him down a darkened memory lane.  He finds himself pulled further and further into his past, seeing old friends and remembering old ideals.  He's pulled so far in, in fact, that he looses his byline with The Hedgehog, his novel, his agent, his girlfriend, his house, and begins to question his sanity.  Strange things are happening to the old band members of Nazgul, tragic things that are slowly leading the band back together.<br /><br />Enter Eden Morse, who wants The Nazgul to reunite.  Eden has found a replacement for Hobbins, going so far as to finance plastic surgery for the young, new singer.  Eden wants Sandy to join them, to become part of the movement again, to use his words as he did in the past to promote The Nazgul.<br /><br />Sandy finds himself in a nightmare when Larry Richmond, the new singer Eden insists on calling 'Pat', begins to change.  Are there forces at work under the darkness of The Nazgul's reunion?<br /><br />The most interesting part of 'The Armageddon Rag' is how Martin weaved together two loves of mine, Tolkien references and hard rock.  As usual, his characters are fully fleshed and breathe life under his words.  The downside is that the book tended to ramble in places, and the ending felt very flat compared to the suspense being built throughout the rest of the story.<br /><br />All in all, if you are a fan of Martin, you should read 'The Armageddon Rag'.  I found I enjoyed it more the first time I read it back in the eighties, but it still holds enough flavor to taste a second time.  Enjoy!mble in places, and the ending felt very flat compared to the suspense being built throughout the rest of the story. <br /> <br />All in all, if you are a fan of Martin, you should read 'The Armageddon Rag'.

"I have never been one to make heroes out of bad guys, but reading this book was like watching \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\" in black & white and I enjoyed the writing style.  The only negative thing was the book went on further than it needed, but I think Mr. Betz was making sure everyone had a fair chance at being quoted.  The style was something I had never seen/read before - it was newspaper articles covering the whole misadventure.  It frequently would include the same incident shown through the interpretation (and sometimes misinterpretation) of various reporters throughout the mid/central west.  Because it includes real characters, places, and incidents, we can discover the communication tools used when our parents were children and our grandparents were young marrieds.  The processes that caught my attention, and appreciation, were legal bodies that worked TOGETHER, not so worried about territorial rights as they were on capturing evildoers.  I appreciated that certain laws didn't exist back then so criminals were treated as criminals, not poor souls who are victims of an upbringing where they had to do chores.  I enjoyed the determination of the law representatives that weren't just going to leave the open case to become part of history - they were determined to follow up, finish up, and close the deal.  All of this (crime, catch, punishment) really takes up only half the book.  The part that drags on is of value to certain groups:  Legal students would appreciate how legal applications apply differently now than back  at the time of the crime.  Researchers will have a good tool in that every article written on the crime is presented in this book; it might seem unnecessary to the casual reader but for thorough research it is necessary.  Names are named and places pointed out - if you are from the area you will find mention of a relative, no doubt.  Under normal circumstances I perhaps would not have picked this as my first choice of a story to read, but from now on I will look for other books by this author, or any other author that writes a book using articles from newspapers.  It made the book very readable, easy to follow, and gave it a feel of happening in \\"real time.\\""	2005-08-31

In grabbing the reigns of Tory leadership, she toppled a mindset that accepted Britain's economic decline as being part of \\"the natural order of things.\\" She also offers insights on the European and international scenes during the middle to late 1970s.

And thoroughly unrealistic. The novel ,which up to the introduction of the Chalfens was rich and realistic and very, very funny, took a downward turn that it barely recovered from due to the ridiculousness of the Chalfen-clan. I am obviously recommending this book, and Zadie Smith IS an extraordinary writer, but I feel that in order to demonstrate one of the book's main purposes of alienation and the search/struggle for a personal and national identity, she unnecessarily, perhaps inadvertantly, streamlined middle-class whites into a forged stereotype. Which is a shame, as the rest of the novel is quite textured and even at times intimate.	2005-08-31

In an interesting touch, the author uses popular song titles of the era for his chapter headings. The one for MacArthur is very appropriate: \\"Too Marvelous for Words.\\"<br /><br />The cultural differences between the Australians and the Americans is, at first, something that both sides can learn from. After a time,it becomes apparent that the Americans are better paid and more popular with the Australian women, and skirmishes begin to break out. Then, a full-scale riot happens (The Battle of Brisbane). It takes some time before things calm down, but Australia was changed forever by the presence of the Americans.<br /><br />There are accounts of the different services, and how they performed in battle. I was glad to see the U.S. submarine force received an entire chapter, and even more surprised to find that one of the boats that my father served on in the Korean War was active in the fleet off Australia (I knew they had been in the Pacific, but had not known it had been that far south!).<br /><br />In all, a good read, and the only book that I've ever found on this subject."	2005-08-31

"Whenever I go to the library of our university, I always go to the shelfs for books that have just arrived. One day, I found standing on the shelf a book titled \\"Chinese Theories of Reading and Writing: A Route to hermeneutics and Open Poetics\\", written by Ming Dong Gu. I was immediately attracted to it. It is a unique book, thoughfully conceived and well written, coming out just in time. This book represents a breakthrough, I think, in the field of comparative study of Chinese and Western poetics, a field which is very active in the past ten years. It is of such a high level, I can only admire the author's accomplishment. Certainly, this book represents the highest level reached in the study of Chinese and Western comparative poetics in the last ten years. In many aspects, I have to describe what the book has accomplished as a breakthrough in the dialogues between Chinese and Western poetics. The topics this book writes about are obviously difficult: hermeneutics, semiotics, Chinese language, philosophy, poetry, Saussure, Lacan, Derrida, Eco, and so on. The author handles these difficult topics brilliantly, in his unique way, and in an easy-to-understand language. He not only delves into some important areas such as the Book of Changes, Buddhism and traditional Chinese literary theory, but also explores the philosophical basis of Chinese reading and writing clearly and artfully. Among scholars of comparative poetics, he is the first one to be able to relate the Dao with cross-cultural theory of reading and writing. Nowdays, many scholars in the field of sinology and comparative literature of Chinese and Western literatures have doubts about the compatibility for comparative studies of Chinese and Western literatures. This book gives us an optimist view. It convincingly demonstrates that Chinese and Western literatures have a common ground in hermeneutics and literary openness. There are many points I very much like in the book. For example, he made a fascinating distinction between Yi \\"meaning\\" and Yi \\"significance\\". It seems that a distinction between Yi and Yi makes no sense for people speaking in English. Even for scholars speaking in native Chinese, they are not always sensitive enough to consider their differences. Yet this author explains the two concepts in terms of You \\"being\\" and Wu \\"nonbeing\\" in a clear and brilliant way and makes sense of some fundamentals in Chinese theories of reading, writing and philosophy: The book is written with highest scholarship and deep insight. I would recommend it to anyone interested in Chinese literature, comparative literature, and comparative thought. <br />"	2005-08-31

For example, the author claims that value investors rely on the efficiency of the markets, when, in fact, what they do is exploit market inefficiencies. I have yet to meet a value investor who believes the Efficient Market Theory. She also compares trading to investing by saying that the goal of trading is to make money, while the goal of equity investing is to preserve capital! Of course preserving capital is certainly important, but have you ever met an equity investor whose goal it wasn't to make money? If capital preservation were the goal, investors wouldn't buy equities, they'd buy bonds or other instruments that guarantee the capital. She also claims that there's no risk management in equity investing, adding that traders do manage risk. The truth is that trading is a losing proposition for most people, and it wouldn't be that way if managing risk was as straightforward as she implies. Trading can be profitable, but don't put much of your money into it (it's too risky), and find a better book than this one!	2005-08-31

This is one of the very clearest books I have ever seen, in any subject.  F.N. David was an outstanding, world-class statistician.  Even though the subject is at the level of a first university/college course, a master of the subject can clearly demonstrate, as she does, exactly what you need to know and why you need to know that.  Rather than just a seemingly unrelated series of tools, techniques and formulae (as, regrettably, so many elementary statistics books present the subject). Ms. David leaves the reader in no doubt as to how everything fits together, and so provides a very firm basis for building to a more advanced level. <br /> <br />My only (small) criticism is that there are no questions for practice, though there are numerous worked examples in the text.  It should not be at all difficult to find exercises for each topic, at the appropriate level of difficulty (e.g., Facts From Figures by Moroney, which is another, and better known, excellent statistics book at the same level). <br /> <br />This book may be a little difficult to obtain, new or used, but it is really worth it.

The left believes that people are inherently good, and that enlightened folks will join together in groups to form public institutions that serve the masses in ways that individual efforts can not for the good of all. The right, on the other hand, operates with the underlying assumption that people, left to their own devices, will act in accordance with their self-interest. Government functions to protect us and our property from each other. This creates the problem of government becoming unchecked. Therefore, people must continually scale back government lest it, too, becomes oppressive according to its own self-interest. How much power should government have, and in what areas should it have any control? That is the big question, not which beliefs about economics or morality are correct or most popular. <br /> <br />Frank demonstrates through argument and example how the right has built a base in Kansas. First, conservatives believe that they have a moral obligation to vote a certain social agenda. Fair enough. However, they fail to see that the economic agenda being promoted within the mechanism that supports their social agenda (the conservative Republican platform). Cutting taxes back to the point that services exist only for those with incomes that can afford it, and supporting market conditions that prohibit individuals from \\"bootstrapping\\" their way into prosperity (cutting education, providing tax breaks to large corporations that stifle competition, etc.) can hardly be seen as compassionate or moral standards. <br /> <br />Second, conservatives in Kansas have perfected playing the \\"victim\\" card. They make a lot of noise about leftists being anti-Christian or pro-abortion or anti-capitalism. They wear their religious creeds like merit badges, but ignore the very ideas that generated those statements (love,compassion, grace and so forth). They consistently confuse political systems with economic systems. It is possible to be both socialist and democratic. It is possible to be both capitalist and fascist. Yet, somehow, any evidence of anyone supporting a view other than theirs stems from immorality or a vast liberal media monolith moving to crush the fine, decent people who only want what's best for everyone. <br /> <br />Finally, the right has promulgated a view of what's best for everyone. The forces of industry produce goods and services. The people will buy them. Industry will base their decisions solely on profit. People will allow industry to tell them what they need. Any attempts to support decisions based on factors like public health, the environment, safety, or personal freedom will be exposed as Communist plots by \\"nattering nabobs of negativism\\". <br /> <br />I realize that these are simplistic explanations for behaviors with lots of variable influencing factors. Frank does a good job of fleshing these theories out. It would've been nice to see a little more data to support his ideas, but he's a journalist, not a social scientist. Still, this book makes some convincing arguments for why people have placed themselves in the camp of the right. In doing so, he also issues a call to the left to provide a truly alternative message, one based on inclusion rather than exclusion. It's not \\"us against them\\". It's just \\"us\\"."	2005-08-31

They need to find out a piece of information quickly. If your site is too flashy, slow to download, or your words don't make any sense, you'll lose their interest. They can go someplace else. This is what you DON'T want to happen.<br /><br />The authors include great examples of site makeovers, showing you what works and what doesn't. For me, it was a great introduction to Nick Usborne, and I've gone on to read his book, NET WORDS. They also pointed me toward Ogilvy, another master of advertising.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the chapter on using poetic techniques to improve copy. \\"You won't snag or woo your customers with drabness; you'll woo them with skillful wordsmithing that penetrates their souls...\\" What follows includes techniques such as frosting, franking, seussing, and frameline magnetism; also, how to develop pace, rhythm, and poetic meter.<br /><br />It's a short read, but full of insight.

US	20595117	R2QZS2RV1018FC	0821225979	147669824	Eisenstaedt: Remembrances	Books	5	3	3	False	False	Light and more light	Eisenstaedt was for more than four decades a central maker of those images through which America held up a mirror to itself, and to the world. His remarkable persistence helped produce some of the most famous photographs of the twentieth century, including the signature- piece photograph of the sailor kissing the nurse at Times Square on V-J Day. Though he presented many pictures of scenes from everyday life in America he is perhaps best known for portraits of the famous, from all walks of life. His Blanchard and Davis captures the pugnacious spirit of the great West Point running duo, his Buckley family portrait captures the casual elegance of America's most famed Conservative intellectual family, his cold camera catches the very epitome of evil hatred in the famed photoportrait of Goebbels, his most difficult subject Hemingway nonetheless projects a somewhat misleading strength and solidity.<br /><br />Eisenstaedt loved his work and lived for it. And there is a certain special kind of light which emanates from his best photographs, the light of life seen into , recaptured on film and presented to us as gift for our immediate viewing and deeper reflection.<br /><br />I by the way strongly recommend reading the more extensive and simply better review by Donald Mitchell of the Eisenstaedt work which also appears on the Amazon site.	2005-08-31

"Before I begin with the actual review I want all you crazy Eragon fans to realize that I know that I am not the age group intended for this book.  Well.... that's what I knew before I began.  I was told that this was a teen fantasy and was written by a teen.  However after the first few hundred pages I realized that this author actually thought that his shallow and bland story could be passed off as real adult fantasy, and then decided to write it that way.<br /><br />His inexperience shows no bounds at his first attempt at writing a story that doesn't know which sub-genre to place itself.  All the elements are there for an adult fantasy, but it is the spirit and personality that are sorely lacking.  A good adult fantasy is more than a really good story, it full of depth and complexity that inspires others to think and use the author's insights philosophically in their own lives.  Eragon does none of that, and here's why:<br /><br />CHARACTERS:<br /><br />The idea of a farmboy suddenly chancing upon this wonderful destiny is really the core plotline for any fantasy story.  It is unoriginal and has been done better by many other authors.  It is obvious that the author intended for the reader to get attached to Eragon the most.  However, this can't happen because Eragon's character developments are too sloppy and they change instantly to whatever emotion is needed for the particular situation.  There are no transition periods between him feeling sad for the villager's deaths to him feeling desperation when trying to save Saphria.  The human emotions felt by the characters are all the same and to the same degrees.  Brom's anger at Eragon is exactly the same as Twins' anger; it is just too generalized. The strongest personality by far was Saphria, only because hers was the only dragon personality that was present.<br /><br />PLOTLINE:<br /><br />What can I say, overdone and taken itself too seriously.  There was no depth, no \\"music\\" (as another reviewer put it).  It did not inspire me to feel sad or happy.  Too many things were stolen from other books, (from \\"true names\\" (Earthsea) to the \\"uncomfortable iron dwaren throne\\" (Song of Ice & Fire)), it was ridiculus.  The idea of magical training is nothing new nor is the idea of linking minds with animals/humans/dragons.  In fact I thought the most interesting and original part was the evil King himself (him alone, not that cheating band of 13 Forloarn or whatever they were called).<br /><br />WRITING<br /><br />The author's inexperience shows.  The story was nothing more than a empty shell with nothing underneath.  The dialogue was too simplistic and the description did not flow well the characters' actions.  I got to the point when I was just kinda simming the description.  It was like there were just blocks of paragraphs in between the story.<br /><br />In all it was not the amazing great book that it was hyped up to be.  The only reason I gave this horrible work two stars was because I ended up finishing the stupid thing just to see what happened to the characters.  I don't think I can stomach another serving of this teen-author who thinks to much of himself.ot inspire me to feel sad or happy.

"I would have thought it impossible that I would give five stars to a work in which an author used such arguably narrow interpretations regarding aspects of other religions in order to strengthen the case for his own. His characterizations of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Judaism (Kabbalah and the Zohar) seemed uncharitably tailored to make Christianity appear, by contrast, inherently superior. It is not the author's preference for Catholicism over these other religions as well as over Protestantism which is the problem. It is his suggestion of Catholicism's objective and essential superiority over them.  <br /> <br />When we consider the absolute conceptually as God, the Godhead, the Tao or the Buddha-nature, we can make as much or as little over their differences as we choose. This also applies to conceptual and interpretive differences between enlightenment and unitive experience as well as to the roles played by love and by the personal aspect in various religious experiences. My sense is that when one is as specific, definitive and as categorical as our anonymous author is regarding those things which are universally recognized as beyond the grasp of the intellect, one is guilty of a kind of intellectual fundamentalism which is kindred to popular fundamentalism in its absolute adherence to the letter of the law to the detriment of its spirit. One cannot diminish the other great traditions without diminishing one's own as well. While Bede Griffiths wrote that he had \\"never read such a comprehensive account of the 'perennial philosophy'\\", this estimable work can be seen from another perspective to be deficient in the ecumenical spirit which properly resides at its core.  <br /> <br />Perhaps another excess is where our author attributes Kant's certainty of God to an \\"intimate experience\\" or \\"authentic spiritual exercise\\" (whatever that means) rather than to a logical or philosophical conclusion. Naturally, Kant is to be seen as a great philosopher and thinker but perhaps not as a mystic.  <br /> <br />However, after all that, this book comes as close as any to being, in a positive sense, without peer. Here, refreshingly, we see great erudition and humility from one and the same author. I read and distilled each chapter down to what I hope is its essential meaning and then, read them again. I was so inspired by the wisdom, clarity, and sheer artistry in this work that I went to the expense of having it printed and nicely bound into two large print volumes so that I could spend even longer periods pouring spellbound over its profound and beautifully written contents. This book is an ingenious composite and integration of religion, philosophy, science and all other relevant elements. It is also literature of the first order. Each presentation of a Major Arcanum is a genuine objet d'art and an exemplar of organization and cohesiveness. One reviewer suggested that this author was in need of structure and an editor. I find it difficult to imagine any editor so audacious as to alter this meticulously crafted spiritual masterpiece by as much as a single word.  <br /> <br />It is all in this book. The dynamics of meditation and transformation, proper spiritual attitudes, the relationship between mind and matter and between God and creation. All of these aspects and dynamics are discussed in great detail and in relationship with one another, philosophy, religion, and with science. You are enriched even from the thought which is provoked by your disagreements with the author, and you are led into your own contemplation of all matter of things spiritual, philosophical and scientific.  <br /> <br />There are few books that do not have some faults that are, in my estimation, equal to the ones which I perceived in this book. There are far fewer, however, for which I would award my five stars so wholeheartedly. Beside the legion of positives in the various reviews recommending this book, the few minor criticisms, while worth noting, are on balance, inconsequential; do not miss the experience of reading this marvel of a book because of them.  <br /> <br />"	2005-08-31

In order for the richness of these poems to be recognized one has to be patient and not read hastily.  One of my favorite poems was \\"Surrender.\\" It's a poem that makes you remember and appreciate the moment you became aware of yourself and were able to go to the next stage of your life wiser and humbler.

"Having loved Annie Lamott's Traveling Mercies, I was thrilled to have stumbled upon Blue Shoe.  However, try as I might, I couldn't force myself to finish it.  I went well past my tolerance level, page 121, simply because I was sure Ms. Lamott would do something, anything, to make the plot move or at least make the characters likable.  This didn't happen (Maybe it did on page 122?  I couldn't wait any longer.)  The only redeeming quality of the book is the exquisite descriptions throughout.  My favorite was \\"She did not mind this weather [rainy], and certainly preferred it to the tyranny of a bright blue day, when old voices told you to get off your duff and go outside.\\"  They are beautiful and rich.  However, it seemed that these descriptions were used in place of plot or character devlopment, so they eventually felt flat.<br /><br />The main character, Mattie, is obviously struggling.  She's a mess, in fact, sleeping with her ex-husband, even after he marries and has a child with the new wife, in addition to having the hots for a married man.  I'm no prude, but there was nothing redeeming about Mattie to make me want to keep reading about this behavior, page after page, or think she might pull herself out of the pit.  I finally gave up hoping that she might redeem herself.  The other people around her offer little to like also: a son who is overly-emotional and bullies his sister, a daughter who bites so much at her wrist she creates and repeatedly reopens wounds, a mother who is emotionally available to everyone but Mattie and her brother,and  the memory of a father who was obviously a cheater.  Add to that an extended dying scene for a dog and constant problems with the house Mattie lives in...I'm getting depressed writing about it.  The only fabulous character, Angela, is mentioned only a few times.  She's a rich, robust character.  Too bad Ms. Lamott focused on the whiny, messy ones instead."	2005-08-31

Unfortunately, it is long and drawn out, and not what a lot of us were hoping for.<br /><br />There's so much going on in the plot - too much in fact. Sam's grisly discovery of a body in his wife's house; his daughter is missing and he is the chief suspect; background from Sam's childhood (where we discover that is his favorite four letter word became a staple in his vocabulary quite early.<br /><br />Other key plot points: an unlikely (and very undeveloped) sub-story where SEAL team leader Tom Paoletti stands accused of aiding the terrorists, because the guns used are ones he reported \\"scuttled\\"; Tom finally marries lady love Kelly in a shotgun-like ceremony; Kelly is a victim of the terrorists; Max finally succumbs to his temptation for former hostage (and much younger) Gina; the burgeoning relationship between Mary Lou and a man of color comes to fruition; the romance of Sam's best friend's grandparent's WWII romance is played out; and Jules is around to give the occasional line of comic relief.<br /><br />All in all, there is just too much, which makes it a bit of a disappointment. The paperback version of the book trudges on for over 500 pages; and the story really stalls in the middle. Without a doubt, the most exciting part of the book is the last 80 pages. Verdict - less time with Sam's past and the WWII back story, and more time with the guys that make this series so great - the Troubleshooters.

The fact that the book takes the better part of an entire chapter to make this point suggesting that the other reviewer skipped a large hunk of the book. <br />  The other reviewer who gets a bit confused is the issue regarding a synagoge in Nazareth, the issue is two fold..one that a small hamlet would not have one nor would have a need for one being only a short distance for Sephorris and second with a population of approx. 400 there would be no chance that such a small community would have something as rare as written text to discuss, and given that the literacy rate was around 3% in this part of the world makes it seem less likely .	2005-08-31

As he takes his most likable male character in Jude and basically ruins him against his 2 least enjoyable female leads in Arabell and Sue. Sue more than anything is infuriatingly fickle and will either make you yell at the book or wish for her early exit. She's a real struggle to cozy up to and yet she becomes the voice for Hardy to express his disgust with social conventions and public morality and what is right and what isn't. etc... Probably contains his harshest plot twists. And as well, his most damning indictments against a rigid world dominated by rules and tradition. Jude is at once trapped and alive with his choices but eventually even his last ounce of love for Sue does him in. Since she's enough to drive even a saint to madness. Hardy really made her as exasperating as possible. Jude becomes a brave soul just for putting up with her...

Her gift is in her voice - the ability to soothe the souls of people in distress with only her words. She has returned to her home town, just in time to celebrate Christmas, and enjoy the annual Christmas pageant, with her family and friends. Little does she know what fate has in store for her this holiday season.<br /><br />Matt Granite is a retired Army Ranger who has recently returned home to take part in the family business. He has loved Kate for years, but figured she was too \\"perfect\\" to ever be interested in a man like him, especially since he had a tendency to act clumsy in her presence, much to the amusement of his brothers. When Kate asks him to do some work for her in a run-down mill she intends to turn into a bookstore, he jumps at the chance to spend more time with her. What he doesn't know is she has always felt the same way for him.<br /><br />While they are inspecting the building, they find an old crypt in the basement, which seems to have been opened by a recent earthquake, allowing something better kept imprisoned to escape. Suddenly Kate feels that an old evil has been freed, something dreadful with plans to ruin Christmas. Its first desire seems to be to destroy Kate, and her family. Matt wants nothing more then to protect his love from the entity set on destruction. Now all seven sisters must join their powers to stop this being once and for all, before it destroys Christmas, her town and family, and her new-found love.<br /><br />Is there nothing the incomparable Ms. Feehan can't write? Once again she has proven herself a master of the paranormal romance genre.

Sparks are evident from their first meeting in the story, igniting rapidly into the 5-alarm blaze their passion develops into. Both are amazed by this, never having believed anything could come of their love for each other. Plenty of humor still can be found, even in the midst of such a dark tale. It is provided by the antics of Mike's brothers, and a couple of Kate's sisters, as they harass the couple, and other family friends.

It's remarkable - I can say a new sentence in the correct word order without consciously thinking what the word order should be(it justs sounds right).  2) rather than translating from English, you learn to \\"think\\" Mandarin.  For example, rather than learning to count 1, 2, 3...., you learn to order 2 beers, then 8 o'clock, 3 o'clock.  You learn to know the numbers  rather than trying to count in your head.   <br /> <br />Despite my limited vocabulary, while in China, I was able to have passable conversations with complete strangers.  It's hard to emphasize how much fun this was.  Some asked if I taught Chinese in the US and most assumed I had much more language skill than I actually do.  Both in the US and China, most say \\"you have a good accent.\\"  To compare, with 6 months of Pimsleur, I was able to develop more language skills than I ever received from 6 yrs of High school & College German (I don't think I ever had a conversation in German).   <br /> <br />With other language tapes, I found the need to constantly rewind.  Pimsleur's approach eliminates the need for this.  Also, in contrast to the many inaccurate Mandarin phrasebooks, Pimsleur's CDs are accurate in translating both the flavor & meaning of words. <br /> <br />One seeming downside to Mandarin I is its apparent overemphasis on numbers.  However, the reason for this emphasis becomes apparent when you start Mandarin II.  In addition to the general utility of numbers, Mandarin II shows that months, days of the week, and many individual words are based on numbers.  Hence, this emphasis is justified. <br /> <br />Downsides:  1. While the CDs are effective in teaching the language, a written booklet would be extremely valuable as a later reference.  Because there is nothing inwriting, if you forget how to say something you have to search thru the CDs to find where the phrase was spoken (there is no table of contents).  Also, a phrasebook would be helpful to carry when in-country. <br />2.  Very few food items are discussed.   Since restaurant visits are common for both tourists and business men (and a place to practice in the US) expanded coverage of handling restaurant situations would be very valuable. <br />3.  I can speak much better than I can comprehend.  Rather than having the last CD give lessons in English, extended conversations in Mandarin would be much more useful. <br /> <br />I'm well into Mandarin II and the CDs remain very engaging.  I'm guessing that when I finish the 3rd set I'll be lamenting the lack of a Mandarin 4.  Considering the growing importance of Mandarin, I hope Pimsleur develops #4."	2005-08-31

In such case, slanted and biased views are deadly, just like any weapon. That is why it is extremely important not to get into the trap of one's nationalism.  <br /> <br />When Umberto Eco wrote his multifaceted masterpiece, \\"The Name of the Rose\\" he , as he himself put it, \\"read and reread\\" an infinite number of medieval chronicles and texts. It seems like Mr. Kadare not only failed to read any, he completely neglected the known historical facts of the period (around 1389 AD) inventing his own history and peoples. Or maybe this was a metaphor for today's cultural and political problems of Kosovo? In any case, \\"Elegy for Kosovo\\" is not worth reading. And here is why: <br /> <br /> <br />From the cover and front flap and through the text, this little book stinks of political, ugly propaganda:  <br />-I happened to read Mr. Milosevic's speech at Kosovo (available on the net) and actually was amazed that anyone could call this a \\"call to arms and ethnic cleansing\\". He never called for repression. That rhetoric was used in order to justify the war crimes perpetuated on Serbs. Not many questioned the official media reports and thus, this big lie still remains a truth to a great majority.   <br />-Contrary to what some \\"amazing professors\\" say, Albanians and Serbs did NOT hate each other \\"since the beginning of time\\". That is a great misunderstanding and neglect of actual connections. There was no animosity between the two peoples in Middle Ages. Quite the contrary. In fact, they coexisted just like anyone else in Europe until the \\"great\\" powers started meddling and applying the \\"divide and rule\\" formula little over a century ago.  <br />-Mr. Kadare writes of Montenegro and Montenegrins. There was NO Montenegro in 14th century. The area was called Zeta and was inhabited by Serbs. \\"Montenegro\\" as aname was a much later \\"invention\\" by the Turk and the Montenegrin nation was Tito's \\"invention\\" in mid `40ies. Same goes for medieval Bosnia and \\"Bosnians\\" - Bosnia is/was a geographical entity where Serbs live(d). King Tvrtko was the king of Serbs.  <br />-King Tvrtko did NOT take part in the battle of Kosovo. The news he received were of Serbian victory. <br />-Belgrade was NOT the capital of Serbia. <br />-Prince Lazar was NOT voted the commander in chief. He was the commander because he was the one defending his estates (page 23).  <br />-No Albanians or Croats took part in the battle, not even all the Serbs. Some Serbian lords wanted Lazar's demise in order to grab his territories. There were no Hungarians either except MAYBE a few mercenaries. Hungary wanted Serbia weak for their own expansionist goals.  <br />-Lazar's sons were NOT executed, in fact, the older, Stefan Lazarevic, would become one of the most interesting rulers of 15th century Europe (First knight of the Order of the Dragon, a poet, an always mesmerizing figure on European courts...).  <br />-\\"Gjergj Balsha\\" was neither an Albanian  nor an Albanian count. He was a Serb from Zeta who did NOT take part in the battle even though he was married to prince Lazar's daughter Jelena. His grandfather fought Albanian tribes. He was of a powerful Balsic family direct ancestors of which still live in Belgrade. <br />-Zeta was a Serbian territory. Today's Macedonia was Serbian territory as well. So, how is it that moving Cetinje (in Zeta) \\"two miles over\\" would lend it in Albania?! Same goes for Skopje (Macedonia) which in 14th century was a Serbian capital. Moving them anywhere would still be within the Serbian lands. This kind of writing on Mr. Kadare's part is exactly in par with the program for Greater Albania that would encompass Kosovo and large chunks of Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia and Greece of today. Similarly, the text on page 60 says: \\" We've left Albania\\" suggesting that Kosovo was part of Albania which was not the case. Fight over Kosovo started in 20th century. <br />-Minstrels singing about taking Kosovo from Serbs/Albanians is utter idiocy. That is one of the examples of projecting today's state of politics and myth into a 14th century history. Very dangerous. <br />-The battle was NOT a defeat of the Serbs. <br />-\\"The Serbs know how to curse better than anyone!\\" (p.64) Shows Kadare's partiality and unfairness.  <br />-\\"...quarrels were always started by those who came last ... when the Serbs had come down from the north, the Albanians had already been there, in Kosovo.\\" (p.68). Another complete fallacy. Albanians still feed on myth that they are the ancestors of the Illyrians, a myth made up in the romantic labs of 19th century Europian powers. It would take too much space and time to dive into this problem here. Let me just say that while Serbian existence is recorded from the 6th century onward (with some archaeological finds dating from 1-3 century) there is no mention of Albanians as such until the second half of the 11th century.  <br /> <br />Mr. Kadare is a fine poet. However, his nationalism is immense and strong. Note that the weakest parts in his writings are always his odes to Albanian superiority and nobility. <br />Skip this little piece of propaganda, of innumerable falsehoods some of which I explained above, and get hold of \\"The three arched bridge\\" and kafkian \\"The Palace of Dreams\\". Always be careful when reading a historical novel specially if it's about a hot media topic. Check the facts yourself, thank God, it has never been easier to get informed.  <br />"	2005-08-31

Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />Fans of Ms. Fuhrmann's fairy godmother series will be more then satisfied with this, the conclusion to the story.<br /><br />Fern, Myrtle, and Blossom have been fairy godmothers forever, their most recent successes being with the Aaronson family of Erie, PA. When they are condemned to life as humans, with none of their powers to help, things get very interesting for them. Though their methods have always been unorthodox, they've never failed one of their charges. Now they are the charges, and they are in for a surprise. The grandmotherly personas they've adopted to make their jobs easier have also been stripped away, and the three are in their true forms, drop dead gorgeous women!<br /><br />The next six months proves to be an eye-opening experience for all of them. They each find new things to do that they enjoy, as individuals rather then a team. Their new lives also bring them the one thing they've never had, their own special kind of love with wonderful men to bring them the happy-ever-afters always granted to others. But what will Blossom, Fern, and Myrtle choose when their time is up? Will they continue to live in this world with the men they love, or will they go back to Fairyland and the lives they've always known?<br /><br />As always, Ms. Fuhrmann charms her readers with a delightful story, full of her trademark wit and humor. Each of the three sisters are unique individuals and the paths they choose to take, as well as the men they come to love reflect that. What is interesting to this reviewer, is that there almost seems to be a change in the three, as to which of them is the strongest. The one who always came across as the least strong, the least independent before shows her true colors in this book and lets everyone see just of what she really is made.<br /><br />The three stories in this book totally intertwine, as well as keeping their uniqueness, through to the end of the book. The men they fall for are perfect complements to them, and there is even a cute surprise at the end.

The evocative title and the glowing moon on the cover greatly piqued my interest.  Somehow, I just knew this would be a good story.  And I was correct.  Being from the Southwest, it was an extra delight to find the story is set in Southern California.  People don't usually associate the desert with ghosts, but there you have it.<br /><br />James Blaylock is an excellent writer.  He weaves a tale by bringing the setting and characters to life.  The story is about Peter, whose ex-wife  and young son have mysteriously disappeared.  The wife was leaving for Hawaii, and the police suggest she has run away in a custody dispute.  The mystery is further compounded by the recurring appearance of a woman and a boy in the windy canyons of Trabuco Oaks, where Peter and his new girlfriend Susan like to hike. Susan has a young son of her own.<br /><br />Susan has a fateful encounter with Pomeroy, a used-car salesman with illusions of his own grandeur.  He becomes obsessed with Susan.  Pomeroy has shady business dealings with Susan's next-door neighbor Klein.  Klein wants Pomeroy out of the way; Pomeroy wants Susan.  But everyone is touched by the strange apparitions, and things get out of control.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who likes a well-written mystery with a touch of the supernatural.	2005-08-31

First of all, it says Evita was two when her father died when she was six. Secondly, it has her getting Peron out of prison when it was labor workers that did that. <br /> <br />Also, the author claims to know what Evita felt. I concur with the above reviewer that, she makes Evita out to be an INHUMAN MONSTER, capable of only one emotion-greed. In fact, on page 35, she writes \\"perhaps the only real emotion she could feel was hate.\\"  <br /> <br />Throughout the whole book Eva is made out to be on the same level as a Hitler, and all her accomplishments are discredited. On pg 236, she writes \\"It was Eva, not Peron, who had the fanaticism of a Hitler.\\" Forgive me, but did Hitler have a foundation for sick children? Evita personally kissed and HELPED the poor, filthy, lepers, those suffering from cancer, and STDs. Under the Eva Peron Foundation, for the first time, there was no inequality in Argenine Health Care. <br /> <br />I do recommend this to the DIE hard Evita fan(like myself) so you get the ANTI-PERONIST view of Evita. For those who want to know the REAL Evita, I recommend Evita:The Real Life of Eva Peron by Fraser and Navarro. Also recommened are Alicia Dujove Orviz's Eva Peron, Tomas Eloy Martinez's Santa Evita and the Peron Novel, and Robert Crassweller's Peron and the Enigmas of Argentina. These are far more objective than this 300 page tabloid."	2005-08-31

This is a truly terrific tale that Ms. Funke has crafted with fantasy loving young readers in mind.  The story focuses on Ben, a boy who befriends a strong, powerful dragon named Firedrake.  Both form alliances with other ingenious characters (including a `Brownie') on their quest for the Rim of Heaven and must find the courage and reliance on these friends in order to defeat the primary nemesis Nettlebrand in addition to other threatening creatures along the way. <br /> <br />This book represents Cornelia Funke's strongest effort thus far as a children's writer.  `The Thief Lord', while entertaining, lacked the overall excitement and creative punch she achieves with `Dragon Rider'. This story would make a perfect read aloud for younger fantasy fans as while very suspenseful, would be less likely to cause sleep problems than other more frightening stories.   If you like `Dragon Rider', also try `Inkheart' a similarly imaginative book by Funke whose only weaknesses are its length and the back and forth nature of the main characters' travels that drag the plot down somewhat.   <br /> <br />	2005-08-31

Offically ruled a suicide, Jan Henderson's exhaustively researched narrative will take the reader down a trail that is often atsonishing and even chilling.  Unlike other books on this famous incident, author Henderson does not indulge in unproven speculation, but relies instead on facts with eye-witness accounts that he verifies and documents.<br /><br /> This book also highlights the life of George Reeves, his extensive work on behalf of charity, and the undying friendship that he earned from his many friends and co-workers, which has not diminished over the decades.<br /><br />  'Speeding Bullet' is nothing less than an incredible book, and should be sought out by fans of both George Reeves, and of true crime mystery books.  This is the one to read.<br /><br /> The comments above were written for the original published book edition of 'Speeding Bullet' of 1999.  They still hold true for the 'Second Edition' (2007), even more so.  In the aftermath of the feature film 'Hollywoodland', author Jan Henderson re-wrote the original manuscript of 'Speeding Bullet' to include revisions and additions to the original text.  He also added a second 'Prologue', and two completely new chapters after the first book ends.  By waiting 8 years after the publication of the first edition, the author has an even sharper perspective of the events in question.  The new chapters contain not only information on the recent motion picture based on Reeves' death, but also some new twists and turns in the case that will startle the readers. Some of it is even emotionally moving.  Jan Henderson has revised and expanded the case file of this unsolved Hollywood mystery, showing that he still had an ace or two up his sleeve. It also contains an additional photo gallery with 81 new and mostly rare photographs.e file of this unsolved Hollywood mystery, showing that he still had an ace or two up his sleeve.

In particular the book expresses many of its ideas in the standard terminology of linguists ; it refers to recent developments in functional linguistics using Thai as a test case ; use of IPA-based phonetic symbols <br />- advanced students of the Thai language who want a deeper understanding of the structure and grammar of the language.  In addition, this audience will learn a great deal about linguistic analysis, as most of the linguistic terminology is carefully defined at the start of each section. <br /> <br />For those of you reading this review who are looking for a book that will help you to learn the Thai language from scratch, this book is not for you yet.  A new student of Thai looking for an introduction to basic Thai grammar would be better served by Higbie's book of a similar title. <br /> <br />I can highly recommend this unique and scholarly work, to linguists wanting to understand Thai grammar, or to advanced Thai students wanting a better understanding of Thai grammar, from the viewpoint of how the language is used. <br /> <br />This is the most scholarly and complete work I have seen on this subject and reflects an enormous amount of work undertaken by the authors.

She can explore anywhere in the city because it, as is the entire Land Of Elyon, is surrounded by a giant rock wall.  This wall was constructed to keep out the unknown of evil and the dark hills.   The town's people do not travel outside this wall and Alexa wants to known exactly why.      <br />Alexa enjoys reading books in Bridewell's library and looking for clues to why the wall has been built and why no one travels outside of these walls.

You know you've got a keeper in your hands when you hate every little interruption that has you putting down the book. That's how this book was for me -- I hated to put it down. From the start it grabbed me.<br /><br />Kendra is a middle school teacher who, after a chance encounter one night, is being stalked by one of the town's most prominent people. Knowing she'd probably get the brush-off because of who the person is, Kendra goes to the police to try to file a complaint. She's not really surprised when Lieutenant Jenkins doesn't believe her, and tells her she's probably mistaken when he learns who Kendra is talking about.<br /><br />Two weeks later, Jinx is still feeling guilty that he didn't do what he could have for Kendra. She reminds him of things he's lost and thought he'd never have again. When he hears of an attack at her school he rushes there to make sure she's not the one hurt. He's relieved that she's fine, and after he notices some changes in her, he's determined to find out why she believes she's being stalked -- then feels bad when he finds evidence that she was telling the truth.<br /><br />From their first meeting, you can see the sparks between Kendra and Jinx, but both are leery since they've both lost a loved one and are not looking for their lives to change. JINXED is a wonderful story of second chances and all the unexpected surprises awaiting them. Ms. Horton writes with such a flair that keeps you riveted until you reach the last page and I can't recommend this book highly enough. I'm a sucker for a true love story and I think JINXED is just that. It just reinforces why I read romance books -- for all those happily-ever-afters.

"I think it is very interesting that when I look at all of the reviews of this book that all of them (except for one) give either the maximum number of stars, or the minimum number of stars.  Could it be that this book is truly either the greatest book ever, or the worst thing written?  I don't think so.  The exact same energy that possesses these reviewers to polarize so strongly on to one side or the other is the same quality of energy that causes wars.  Question: does a true peace activist spend thier time attacking one who writes a book advocating peace, for petty things like the origin of a quote about peace?  I don't believe that either Gandhi or AJ Muste would spend thier time attacking other peace activists about the origin of quotes.  I also don't think that they would have spent thier time sucking up to each other either. They were too busy being the change they wanted to see. How do you want to expend your energy?     Historically, people who have caused very strong polarization in opinion and ideas have gone on to be judged by history as either mad or great.  And the determining factor for madness or greatness is usually determined by the cause that the person was fighting for.  Deepak tends to be a fairly polarizing figure these days, but  since his cause is peace, I believe history will be kind.      I have given this book three stars because that is a neutral rating--it's only fair--I have not yet had a chance to read it.  Kudos to Deepak for spending his energy in a creative way for a cause he believes in.  A beautiful cause.    For those who criticize other peace makers in the name of peace, I offer the words of Mother Theresa:     \\"Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today. Let us begin.\\"     I pray that we all may find creative and positive ways to advance the cause of peace, instead of spending our energies tearing fellow peacemakers down.  What are you doing right now?    NOTE: I believe that the above words were spoken byMother Theresa, but perhaps I am mistaken.  But it really does not matter.  The only thing that matters is that is was said by someone who transcends the low level thinking that breeds anything but peace.  BE a peacemaker."	2005-08-31

By following along with the photos, I have been able to successfully complete two projects in this book, and I am beginning another one.<br /><br />The patterns are very nice.  Of course, as with any pattern book, there are some that I have no interest in making, but there are at least 5 more that I can't wait to try.<br /><br />One reviewer has said that the patterns are monotanous with lots of knitting.  Ms Melville states in the book that these projects were designed with lots of knitting on purpose, in order to have the new knitter practice, practice, practice.  To me, there is an upside and a downside to this.  The upside:  by the time I finished the bulky yarn poncho, I had mastered the knit stitch and tension.  The downside:  I would like to make the Best Friend Jacket ( a cool assymetrical sweater ), but in order to get enough yarn for it, I'm going to be dropping a chunk of money for the yarn.  This can be daunting for a newbie, who is unsure of their commitment to the craft (I, personally, am ordering my $100 worth of yarn today for the jacket, after 3 weeks of debating whether I would actually finish it or not)<br /><br />A side note on the patterns I have finished:  The super bulky weight poncho turned out AWESOME.  With her instructions I was able substitute some 100% wool yarn I found on sale, and the finished product looks incredible.  Also, the Shape It! scarf:  addictive!  I will be making several more.

Nosworthy gives excellent detailed examples from the era showing how each of the combat arms dealt with each of the combat arms of their opponents.  He shows the importance of morale and how 18th century doctrine evolved into Napoleonic tactics.  Skirmishers preceded attacking infantrymen, and columns were generally used not so much for attack as they were for maneuver toward the enemy where the men would then deploy into line.  The French used lines more than has been generally thought.  This system worked against everyone but the British, whose superior skirmishers kept the French columns in the dark until British infantry fired a volley and charged just as the French were attempting to deploy.  This book is essential to understanding Napoleonic warfare.	2005-08-31

As with the two preceding titles in the series, each story revolves around the same element, in this case, stone.<br /><br />In The Shattered Stone by Rosemary Laurey, Alys is left alone after both her parents die from the gray plague. Forced out of the only home she has ever known, Alys sets off on a westward journey to find the home of her mother's people. Along the way, Ranald ven Strad, serving the monarch by hunting down a long lost relative, comes to her aid. Little did either of them know that The Shattered Stone pendant Alys carries is the answer both of them are seeking.<br /><br />The Shattered Stone is a wonderful quest story. Alys has nothing left of her life except the few hidden items of her mother's she found. All she wants is to grieve for her parents but circumstances won't allow for that. She shows strength and grit in her decision to venture out alone, against the odds. Ranald is a man on a mission who never lets personal feelings get in his way. Yet something about the innocent Alys reaches out to him and makes him want more for the first time in his life. Seeing these two find peace and happiness together makes for a passionate love story. I do think Ranald was a little bit too oblivious to who Alys really was but I guess that had to be the case to allow the story to progress to the requisite Happy-ever-after.<br /><br />Halfling Li is exiled from her home and her people when she reveals she would be happier living amongst the humans than with the elves who have never treated her well. Now working at Graystone House, her job is to take care of the Evil Ones - hundreds of stone gargoyles, rumored to be cursed, that make her nervous. When she accidentally releases Nikolaz \\"Nik\\" of Riverhaven from his stone prison, Li finds out that the best things in life come After the Rain.<br /><br />In After the Rain, we find a little bit of everything that makes fantast romance so popular. Here we have witches and curses, gargoyles and elves, and a love that transcends them all. Li was heartbroken over her family's betrayal yet still believes someday she'll meet the right one to love her. When she accidentally releases Nik, he does not trust Li, convinced she is the witch who cursed him and takes her captive.

This book helps accomplish exactly that.  Siegel examines personal and societal fear through a physician's eye - first studying and understanding the mechanisms which we experience as fear, and then examining and diagnosing how we've been using those mechanisms.  The perspective and lessons are insightful and useful, making this a worthwhile read.  It is also an easy read, peppered with case studies and stories which make it enjoyable while addressing this serious subject.	2005-08-31

The word 'solar' applies in fact to all sources of energy that are ultimately derived from sunlight, as the book deals with alternative energies such as wind energy, biomass and tidal, not just photovoltaic. Here is an author who has a good grasp of the technical aspects of energy as well as the political ones. <br /> <br />In fact, the data and conclusions the author brings forward are cold harsh reality that might shatter a dream or two. This is good. Dreams that cannot come true but distract us from reality have to be shattered, the sooner the better. Making energy manageable will take enough efforts as it is, and distractions must be done away with. Especially people who think they want to do something 'green' but haven't really thought about it might want to read this book. Policy makers would do well to read it. Even the advocates of alternative energy might, if only to think about how to counter the author's arguments.  <br /> <br />The use of language in this book is rather informal, as if it were a conversation being held around the coffee table. I imagine the author making his statements with a loud voice and with little room for misunderstanding his words. In fact, this is part of what annoys me about this book. It seems that the author has a great dislike of certain individuals or groups. The strength of the facts and explanation of the facts is undermined greatly by this. An author who makes a point of seeming to be biased can be dismissed too easily by his opponents. That would be bad in the case of Howard Hayden because his words need to be heeded especially by policy makers who are likely to waste tax money on unrealistic projects. <br /> <br />A second thing that I think could have been better is the way this book deals almost entirely with US politics. There are relevant things to be said about this subject from for example Japan and Europe, both politically and technically. Perhaps the author means to adress a US audience primarily, but comparison with similar economies would not hurt.	2005-08-31

Corrine writes historical fantasy romances featuring Mykhayl Tibronson, the High King of Torhtremer, and his family, while Celeste is the author of a futuristic/sci-fi series starring Jarred Varrain, an enforcement officer.  Mykhayl and Jarred have each gone on many dangerous adventures through the sisters' books.  What Corrine and Celeste don't know is that somehow, some way, what they've written has become reality in two alternate universes.  Worse yet, Jarred and Mykhayl know about them and plan to take their revenge.  In a bold move, Jarred and Mykhayl penetrate our dimension and kidnap the sisters (while they're in the middle of trying out lingerie, no less).  Now it's payback time for Corrine and Celeste as they each face a furious and handsome (not to mention well-endowed) warrior.<br /><br />In Diane Whiteside's BOUND BY THE DRAGON, Mykhayl Tibronson, the High King of Torhtremer, has brought back his tormentor for punishment.  Thanks to Corrine, Mykhayl has been imprisoned and tortured numerous times by his enemies.  Worst of all, she caused an ice serpent to bite him and render him sterile.  An intolerable situation for a king.  Mykhayl intends to make sure that this sorceress will no longer be able to make his life hell, even if he has to shackle her to his bed.<br /><br />Bewildered, bemused and definitely aroused (after all, she's very familiar with every inch of that physique) Corrine finds herself accused of being a sorceress and being eyed as a tasty snack both my Mykhayl and the imperial dragon, Khyber!  Wanting to make amends for all that she unknowingly put him through, Corrine is determined to cure his sterility and help him fight his enemies, even if it means being stuck in this universe forever.<br /><br />In Angela Knight's BOUND BY THE DREAM, Jarred Varrain finally has his chance to avenge himself on Celeste.  Because of her he'd been betrayed by the woman he loved, tortured by alien reptiles and, worst of all, had watched her plot his best friend's death but was powerless to stop it.  Yet for all she's put him through, Celeste has also been his obsession for years.  To ensure she will wreak no more havoc in his world, Jarred plans to give Celeste to his friend De'Lar as a new sexsub.  But first, Jarred is going to torture her slowly, exquisitely, on his specially made pleasure rack.  He was going to rid himself of his fixation once and for all.<br /><br />Once she realizes that everything she's written has truly come to pass, Celeste expects Jarred to kill her.  Instead, she's tortured with pleasure and Celeste slowly realizes a truth she's hidden for a long time.  She's never been able to have a real relationship because a part of her has always been in love with her hero, Jarred.  Now he's real, but her days with him are numbered unless he can forgive her and she can convince him they belong together.<br /><br />CAPTIVE DREAMS wraps itself around that eternal question \\"What if?\\" and the result is raunchy and a lot of fun.  Corrine and Celeste make fabulous heroines who, after learning to believe in the improbable, immerse themselves in their new worlds and find a way to adapt and relish their new roles.  Mykhayl and Jarred evolve from men bent on vengeance to heroes worthy of their unusual heroines.  Erotically charged, lushly romantic, and yes, slightly kinky, this delicious anthology may not be for everyone but it's a Perfect 10 in my book.<br /><br />TheSchemere himself on Celeste.

The prevailing image of the captive is that of a young woman. Several of these women remained with their captors despite the payment of ransom and the pressures of their families to return to America because they found in French Catholic Canada empowerment denied them in Puritan America. Despite the stereotype, Bill Foster has found that boys and men constituted more than 80% of those taken from 1675-1763. Bill's discovery and scholarship significantly and importantly opens up the gender discussion for early American history because these Puritan men found themselves working for and taking orders from French and former American Catholic women many of whom were quite young. This condition the men found shameful and degrading and only a handful became assimilated to the French Catholic culture. Those who returned frequently would not name their captor because of the shame of having been bossed by a woman. Bill's research in the archives in Canada and the U.S. sheds new light on these highly prejudiced male captivity narratives.	2005-08-31

Courtesy of Love Romances Reviews<br /><br />The story of the Coven of the Wolf continues in this, the second tale.<br /><br />It was Summer Solstice and Brenna Lindsay was paying homage to the Goddess when everything she knew changed. There was a murder in the forest adjacent to her land and she sensed the terrible evil behind it, threatening the peace of her town.<br /><br />Ty Buchanan is sheriff in town and is investigating the murder. When he meets Brenna, the attraction is immediate and intense. He doesn't understand this sudden passion; he only knows that she will be his.<br /><br />As Ty and Brenna partner up to solve the murder case, and the overabundance of dark magick in their town, their ardor consumes them both. They are destined to be together, Goddess has seen to it. As the evil grows the closer they get to the heart of it, they must rely on their love for one another, Ty's dormant magick, and all of Brenna's skill with Moon Magick, to win the battle once and for all.<br /><br />Here is a story full of passion, suspense, magick, and underlying strength of character. The plot flows seamlessly from beginning to end, snaring the reader in its spell. This story expands on the world introduced in Destiny's Magick, yet is able to stand on its own. Here too, Ms. Morgan continues her trend for portraying strong heroines to save the day.<br /><br />Brenna is a great woman, full of power and courage. Ty is the ultimate alpha male, bound to protect his woman at any cost, even when he is the one needing saving. They are perfect together, each strong where the other is weak. It was also enjoyable to have a chance to visit once more with some beloved characters from the previous story. Boris and Igor, the twin Russian shape shifters are back, playing a key role in this story, and adding some lively moments. It was fun to see Igor's antics, especially as he fancies himself in love with Brenna, and desires her for himself. Drake and Rhea, the powerful coven leaders, even have a cameo, much to the delight of readers. Add in a suitably evil villain, a bevy of bad guys (and gals), several coven members, and Brenna's beloved pet wolf, Star, and fans have a delightful cast of characters to round out the plot.<br /><br />This reviewer is one fan who is eagerly awaiting Ms. Morgan's next chapter in the story of the Coven of the Wolf.

"One of the many things I agree with from this series of books is that there really is only two emotions -- love and fear.  Well, if Jesus taught love, and the being they feel is opposite (\\"Satan\\") is the other (fear shall we say), which emotion are the one-star reviewers feeling in their hearts and transmitting to the world?  Hmmmm.... doesn't feel like love to me. <br /> <br />How about the lessons regarding judgment from Jesus?  Do you know the difference between judgment and discernment?  Discernment would be knowing in your heart that this book isn't for you and not reading it at that moment -- and that is good.  It is your \\"truth\\" -- the truth you feel and know inside -- and that is of great value!  Judgment is first feeling fear, and then because you don't want to look inside to figure out why you are afraid, to attempt to scapegoat someone or something by calling names and making outrageous statements or assumptions, i.e.,  \\"The World is Flat\\", \\"The Earth is the center of the universe and everything revolves around it\\", \\"Indians are savages\\", \\"Black people are.....\\", etc. (take your pick) of the many \\"judgments\\" that Christians and other religions have made in the last 2,000 years and before.  It is true that there were a lot of people who didn't believe that Jesus was anything special until he died.  How many other wonderful people do we need to scapegoat or kill before we start feeling truth in our hearts, instead of our minds?  Can't we start being more responsible for what we are feeling and change it -- rather than attempting to give it to another?  Can't we instead look for the truth in each person or situation that we see, instead of what we don't like? <br /> <br />If this book isn't for you, and you know that in your heart, then use good discernment and by all means, don't read it. However, judging it, i.e., call it \\"New Age\\", \\"horsesh__\\", \\"Satanism\\", \\"written at a 3rd grade level\\", etc., and then sharing your judgments with others isn't very Christlike and therefore, not very Christian. Wouldn't you agree?  So who is really acting more Christlike and therefore, Christian?  Neale Donald Walsch or you? <br /> <br />One reviewer said the books contradicted the Bible, i.e., \\"Jesus is the way\\".  Maybe the Bible meant, \\"Being as Jesus was, IS the way\\" instead of the literal mind-based thought that Jesus is the way?  Isn't it a tad irresponsible to say that you can achieve something without earning it yourself?  Have you ever seen a spoiled child who has been left alone by their parents with all the money in the world and they don't have to do anything themselves to earn their way?  Saying that you can make it anywhere on another person's merits just doesn't work in this life or anywhere that I'm aware of.  Doesn't it seem like it is a Universal law that you achieve only what you put into something? <br /> <br />Yes, the Bible has some wonderful truths and one of those \\"truths\\" is that God created you, right?  Well, isn't believing that God would put you here and only give you good information every 2,000 years or less (no matter what man had done to change or grow, etc.), the same as believing that it's okay to give birth to a child, give them one book, leave them totally alone to study from it without any of your help, and say it's the only book of  truth?  As I've heard Mr. Walsch say, That would be like going into surgery with a very sharp stone. <br /> <br />Things that make you go, hmmmmm? <br /> <br />This series of books is very uplifting, freeing, loving, nonjudgmental and helps people to realize who they really are --   a true extension of the Creator.  How about we really start walking all of our Christian talk and BE who we really are?  How about we really listen to what Jesus taught and really put it into practice?  Has the Bible helped you to do that?  If so, great!  If not, these books just might."	2005-08-31

In spite of success and marriage to a nice sweet person, Michel remains discontented as he still fails to achieve his objective of parental approval.<br /><br />This is a terrific dance saga and though Michel is the main character, the novel contains side tales of several other key players so that the prime cast seems genuine whether it is a scorning father, a cold mother, a nurturing yet demanding teacher or a sweet wannabe actress.  Still the in spite of the powerful characterizations, ballet is the star of this five star production.  Readers will appreciate this strong look over several years inside the life of a classical dancer and those in his sphere.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner	2005-08-31

"As far as Shadowrun adventures are concerned this one is relatively standard fare. You look for a missing person and unearth something more sinister. Compared to other Shadowrun adventures this one is about average as far as complexity and plot development are concerned. What makes this adventure stand out above and beyond other Shadowrun adventures isn't the physical adventure per se, but rather the implications regarding what the adventurers find out and how that is presented.  <br /> <br />Basically the biggest treat in this adventure is a player handout that actually has more pages than the adventure book itself. This handout is essentially a net conversation between two reporters over the course of a few weeks that reveals one of the greatest threats to the Sixth World. This handout alone is worth getting the adventure. Where the gameplay is merely average this one aspect puts that \\"average\\" adventure into a whole new level.  <br /> <br />I have seen this book sell in auctions as high as $50 or more. My guess is you can probably get it for a good deal less with a little patience (seems interest in these books comes in waves). As far as value is concerned I would say if you really like conspiracy theories that delve into sci-fi and fantasy then paying $40+ might actually be worth it. Whether you're frugal or not in your Shadowrun adventure purchasing this particular adventure is a must have."	2005-08-31

I spent nearly six months working through it and found that nearly every page of the transcripts contain errors or omissions of one kind or another. Grammar, when it is explained, is written in jargon that I can't comprehend.  The audio is variable in quality and antiquity and not all the speakers on the audio are native Spanish speakers.  I purchased this programme because I had read on the internet that Platiquemos was one of the leading self-teach Spanish language programmes, but I am disappointed in the quality of the product and the effort, time and money that I have wasted on it.  I thought Platiquemos would be a good follow on from Pimsleur 1,2,3&Plus - big mistake.  This programme needs a complete overhaul with TLC.  The idea is sound, but accuracy and native speakers are essential.  I, for one, prefer the original.  I am now in the process of working my way through Learning Spanish Like Crazy and the elements of grammar are now becoming clear and I am making progress.  My advice to you is, get the right tool for the job and steer clear of this one. One star is one too many for this product.	2005-08-31

Some parts are comedic; some are tragic; and a lot of history is thrown in--yielding a fascinating narrative mixture.  Set in the 1920's (around the time of the discovery of King Tut's tomb) and the 1950's -- and switching back and forth between the two eras -- the story focuses upon the search by the central character for an as yet undiscovered Pharaoh's tomb three or four years after the end of World War I.  The intriguing device is that the main character spells out his progress through a diary and letters to his fiance as his search progresses.  Intertwined with this narrative are letters from a retired detective in Australia (written in the 1950's) recounting his investigation during the 1920's of the central chracter at the time of his Egyptian search and excavation.  I found the novel overly long, and the central plot device (which I will not reveal) to be fairly obvious long before the book concludes.  The final pages left me feeling as if a number of issues had not been resolved.  Nonetheless, really quite a creative piece of writing and a good read.	2005-08-31

The author manages to weave theoretical material about grief and mourning in and amongst her very private journal entries and personal experiences, which makes this work valuable not only to mothers and grandmothers but to mental health professionals as well.  The book is clinically accurate and current, incorporating material from leading experts on bereavement as well as anecdotal experiences gathered from other bereaved grandparents, so that it will appeal to clinicians as well as members of the lay public.  I especially appreciate how, through her own touching examples, this author gives bereaved families permission to keep the memory of their  babies alive and to continue to develop a connection with them through the years.  As Lorraine Hedtke so accurately observes (...), sadness is only one aspect of the complexity of grief, and remembering is what helps us manage our sorrow more effectively.  I have listed this book on the pages of my Grief Healing Web site (...) as one I highly recommend to my site visitors, clients and colleagues.	2005-08-31

That being said, if you can tough it out through this book, ALL of the other Shannara books and series are well worth reading. There are some direct parallels and some original ideas, it wasn't quite all a copy of Lord of the Rings... The writing is good, though maybe a bit unoriginal. This was my least favorite Shannara series book just because it seemed to be such a ripoff of Tolkien. I still enjoyed the book and would recommend it, just be warned that it is similar to LOTR. It does set the stage for the other books in this series and the other Shannara series books, and is worth reading just for that. None of those are anything like Lord of the Rings and Terry Brooks' creativity shines through in those. I also went on to read the Magic Kingdom of Landover series which are also good.	2005-08-31

Perhaps it has to do with adolescent \\"reverse psychology\\": a book required for school can't be enjoyable -- by definition.<br /><br />Be that as it may, my daughter, a high school senior, writing her first essay for AP World Lit. and Comp., chose to write about Life of Pi, which she read on her own, not as required reading.  Although not written as a book review, I feel it belongs here.  In her words:<br /><br />While trapped on a lifeboat occupied by an adult male Bengal tiger, Pi Patel writes: \\"My greatest wish--other than salvation--was to have a book. A long book with a never-ending story. One I could read again and again, with new eyes and a fresh understanding each time.\\" This book, for me, is Life of Pi by Yann Martel. The same book also happens to be where I got the quote. It's hard to write about what it means to me, because whenever I look for a starting point by thumbing through the book I get distracted and have to reread all my favorite parts...again.<br /><br />Life of Pi taught me to believe the unbelievable. Sure, it's just a story, to be read for entertainment. Piscine Molitor Patel, Pi for short, tells us how he survived on an ocean journey in a lifeboat from his home in India to Mexico. But that's not even my favorite part. Pi has a striking sense of individualism, and despite his family's bewilderment, becomes a devout Hindu, Muslim, and Christian. Why not be all three? According to Bapu Gandhi, \\"all religions are true.\\" Pi adds that \\"if there's only one nation in the sky; shouldn't all passports be valid for it?\\" After his ocean escapade, he goes on to double major in zoology and religious studies. Rather encouraging for me, considering that I still respond with \\"I haven't decided yet\\" to adults and admissions officers.<br /><br />Pi's tale of survival is sensational at times and completely fantastical at others, yet I was with him every step of the way. It was the winter break during my junior year of high school, and I was exactly where I should have been: in bed with a great story. Life of Pi washed away the indifference, at least temporarily, that I think plagues everyone midway through their junior year. Pi needed to live so badly, even when it seemed he had nothing to live for. So many people would have jumped ship, but it never crossed his mind. Not that I thought much about jumping ship, but Pi's story made me realize the true meaning of willpower, and how important it is to enjoy your life.<br /><br />Life of Pi provided me with a more hopeful, restored outlook on life. Did I love it? Yes. Did it change me for the better? Probably. Is it the only book with the capability to do so? Of course not. People read literature because each book means something different, teaches something new. Books entertain and take you to new worlds. Literature leaves written legacies of time, people, places, and ideas. Life of Pi did all of these things for me, and thus illustrates why I read.<br /><br />\\"I left town and on my way back, at a point where the land was high and I could see the sea to my left and down the road a long ways, I suddenly felt I was in heaven. The spot was no different from when I had passed it not long before, but my way of seeing it had changed.\\"<br /><br />Exactly.winter break during my junior year of high school, and I was exactly where I should have been: in bed with a great story.

"In this novel set in the Philippines in the 1970s we first meet Zamora, a wealthy Spanish landowner, as he helicopters to a remote area and discovers a small band of people who are still living the stone age.  His study of this group of people seem to be his hobby and his passion.<br /><br />We also meet a young girl who is a servant in his home as well as his troubled German wife who soon grows weary of her unhappy life.  There's some political intrigue and some interesting characters and the story had a good chance of holding my interest.  Alas, though, the author left too many connecting details out to give it a coherent narrative flow and although I continued reading, the plot never quite hung together.  When I finished the book I still wasn't sure what it was about although it raised the questions that perhaps there wasn't a stone age tribe at all, but just a plot on the part of the corrupt government to give Zamora access to areas which would be politically advantageous to the dictator.  If this doesn't make sense to you, it doesn't make sense to me either.<br /><br />Add to this a Hollywood film crew that has come into the town to make a movie about the Vietnam War.  This section of the book was probably based on the filming of \\"Apocalypse Now\\"  This part seemed to flow along well until it, too, lapsed into postmodernism and left more unanswered questions.<br /><br />There were some parts of the book that were extremely well done. One was the voice of the servant girl character.  However, this one character was not enough to save this book from being hard to follow. On the whole, in spite of some good descriptions of the locale, Dream Jungle was too disjointed for me to recommend."	2005-08-31

Maria Grazia Battestini was an old women about whom nothing good could be said, not even by the most generous of souls. Whoever had killed her must have taken her completely by surprise.    Battestini maid an illegal Romanian woman was missing and currently the prime suspect, the police were hot in pursuit. Located at the central station trying to leave the country the maid is killed in a fatal train accident. only suspect dead, case closed.    Commissario Brunetti has just return from his vacation. His first day back on the job he encounters Signora Gismondi who also had just returned from a vacation in London. Signora Gismondi was Maria Battestini neighbour and had learned of her death on her return. Signora Gismondi also knew the Romanian maid, and is rather forthcoming with some relevant information. Brunetti intrigued - unofficially - investigates. The motive looks like greed or was he looking at the wrong deadly sin.    Doctored Evidence is the thirteenth novel in the Brunetti series and for me my first. This book does not disappoint as murder has been set off against the backdrop of Venice. Donna Leon the author lives in Venice you can clearly see from the writing that she enjoys living there, the story flows really well and beautifully pieced together. Commissario Brunetti is a character you warm to straight away but also for me in this book, Brunetti's source of information Signorina Elettra is a great character, a women who uses her contacts and connections, which seem just as corrupt, Elettra mind is as sharp as a razor. When reading murder mysteries I always try to put a face to the characters in Signoriana Elettra case an Italian actress by the name of Claudia Gerini came to mind. A face for Commissario Brunetti I will have to investigate more, that's going to be a tough one. Donna Leon has written a whole Brunetti series of whodunit, so I will be backtracking to the beginning and with thirteen left to read through, my mind will be occupied for quite awhile.	2005-08-31

The House on Mango Street contains snippets and flashes and scenes from the childhood of a Latino girl named Esperanza who lives in a poor section of Chicago.  The glimpses into her life are told from her point of view, told with the innocence of a child at first but then with less and less as she gets older.  Some of memories are happy and some are quite sad.  She tells of interesting people she encounters on Mango Street, giving a child's impression of odd neighbors and relatives.  We learn about her sister Nenny and her fried Sally.  In just a few words, we as adults know enough of the situations to understand some of the things she does not.  That makes the stories even more poignant.  It is a short book and makes you want to know more about Esperanza.	2005-08-31

But if anyone could possibly pull it off, Yancey is the one. With a degree in English and a background in theater, he knows how to write well and can spin a story. Sometimes he gets carried away with literary pretensions, but only rarely. For the most part, he tells a tight and tense story.<br /><br />Yancey was a collections agent. He hunted down delinquent taxpayers and made them pay. If they refused or couldn't pay, he attached their bank accounts, repossessed their cars, and seized their homes and businesses. You can perform all sorts of mental contortions to deal with a job like that, but it will get to you one way or another. No one leaves unscathed.<br /><br />I would not have believed Yancey's characterizations of his colleagues and bosses if I had not been in federal service myself for fifteen years (not with the IRS). The psychotic mind games, the petty one-upsmanship, the general attitude that your agency and profession is the hub of the universe; sadly, it all rings true. Even the cartoon-like uber-agent William Culpepper must have been real.<br /><br />Yancey telegraphs a fair amount of the story. You know as soon as he mentions her \\"mousey-brown hair\\" that his fiancee will not be with him by the end of the story. You know with his first description of the woman he eventually ends up with with that she will be the one. I was not able to predict whether he would stay with the agency after the first year or if he would get out before he sustained permanent damage, only because I was hoping against hope that he would take the advice of every interviewer, every supervisor, every colleague, to get out, get out, get out!"	2005-08-31

Nelon:  For the curious armchair traveler who likes to encounter strange cultures that are far removed from the norm of our standard Western Culture, James R. Nelon's \\"Pursuing A Dream\\" is a good read. Nelon, who took off a year from the corporate rat race of the business and computer world, gives us a book of detailed descriptions and intimate photography of village life in remote areas of Indonesia. Nelon does a wonderful job of letting the reader see through his descriptions and photos just how different life can be on this planet. From his presence at a festival and burial ceremony in the village of Rantepao, Tana Toraja, to observing the life around Lake Tempe in Sulawesi, to a trip to the mystic Seram Island, to life in a longhouse in West Kalimantan, Nelon emerses the reader in the lives of Indonesians that are far removed from the lifestyles of  today's tourists. His photos of the people are particularly striking and give a face to the culture being described. As a reader, I found myself wishing each picture had been placed in the book beside the descriptive paragraphs; however, today's publishing costs may have forced the photos to their placement in two groups of numbered pictures. Nelon's description is excellent but the reader will find some lack of transition between events or places, as the book is more journalizing than well connected narration. Readers will also want a map of Indonesia and Asia while reading if they are not familiar with that part of the world. Also, I was confused by the insertion of the narrations of the death of his dog Barclay, his approach and relationship to his religious background, and his grandmother. All of these were well written pieces but I couldn't follow their connection to the Indonesian experience. But all in all the book is a valuable look into a faraway culture that seems not of our times"	2005-08-31

In case you are not a regular to contemporary \\"graphic novels\\" (as book-length comics are now called--a little pretentiously, in opinion) these are not common features of the genre. So I found this very refreshing, and quite interesting as a document that rings very true, at the same time that it runs counter to much of the conventional wisdom we hear on the news. The story builds gradually, with plenty of time for real human details to emerge in everyday dialogue, jokes, and intimate discussions between soldiers. And having the highly detailed artwork right there with the realistic daily soldier talk really formed a full picture in my mind. Strangely, I got a better sense here of what the actual work of an infantryman in Iraq is like today than in any of my non-fiction reading. Highly recommended."	2005-08-31

If readers want an incredible werewolf story with a twist, then this book is one that must be read.<br /><br />Officer Jessie McQuade has seen much in her job as a policewoman, but strange things have been happening in Miniwa, Wisconsin lately. The normally subdued wolves in the area are striking out, attacking humans for no apparent reason. As she investigates deeper, more and more leads don't tie up, and many doubts surface. Everything comes back to the huge, lone black wolf she keeps seeing everywhere. So her practical nature causes her to turn to a professor for help.<br /><br />Will Cadotte is an expert in Native American mythology and the logical person for Officer McQuade to turn to when an animal totem charm is found. He has a lot of answers, but even more questions are raised as he helps in her investigation. The things he talks about are unbelievable to Jessie, things that just cannot be. And what's the matter with her? She's inexplicably drawn to this enigmatic man, and he makes her toes curl in the most delightful of ways.<br /><br />As things grow stranger and the time for the full moon, a rare Blue Moon, draws near, danger is more imminent and Jessie doesn't know what to believe. All of the evidence is pointing to something she can't even begin to comprehend or accept. Is it really something supernatural and therefore beyond her control? And what about Will, is he friend or foe, incredible lover or deadly enemy, man or man-wolf? Want to know the answers, then drop everything and read this book!<br /><br />Welcome back to the paranormal genre, Ms. Handeland! This story is one of the best this reviewer has read in quite a while. The plot leaps and bounds forward, like the running wolves, but is not in the slightest bit confusing or disturbing. One will become entrenched in the story from the very first line, and want to keep reading uninterrupted through the end. The Native American mythological spin on the legend of the werewolves adds depth to the story, making it all the more intriguing for the tantalizing glimpses into those beliefs.<br /><br />Jessie is a great character, full of sass and with a delightful, sarcastic sense of humor. One will laugh out loud many times as a result of her unexpected witticisms. Will is a hero to drive women crazy, tall dark, handsome, and yes he's got a brilliant mind to go with it! Who wouldn't fall for a guy like that? Jessie didn't stand a chance. Add in the very elderly police dispatcher, Zee, with the mouth of a sailor, who loves her job and loves Jessie like a daughter, a very frightening wolf hunter who may be more then he seems, and a score of townspeople, and this story has incredible life built in to it.<br /><br />This story is absolutely incredible and the only bad thing about it? That it can't go on forever! Have no fear readers, there are already at least two more books in the works to extend this foray into the otherworldly. Ms. Handeland has a breakout hit with this series! This reviewer is one fan who will be impatiently awaiting the next chapter in the saga.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, June 2004.

So covering the history and people of California in the same pages that are accorded all of the other 50 states covered in the America the Beautiful Second Series is a daunting task for author Ann Heinrichs.  All she can really do in these pages is introduce young students to the state.<br /><br />Chapter One, \\"In California, They...,\\" establishes the key idea of diversity as the one word that best describes the state, whether you are talking landscape or residents.  The state's history is laid out in the next three chapters.  Chapter Two, \\"The Early Years,\\" starts with the first Asian people to cross the land bridge to North America before moving on to the Spanish and Mexican periods of California history.  Then comes the Bear Flag Revolt of 1846, which ended up with the area as part of the United States.  Chapter Three, \\"Gold, Railroads, and the Promised Land,\\" begins with the 49ers showing up to pan gold, continues as California becomes a state, and ends with the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 and the Great Depression.  \\"Modern Times\\" is the title for Chapter Four, which looks at how World War II transformed California into a modern industrial state and the issues it faces today.<br /><br />\\"California Landscapes\\" are explored in Chapter Five, which includes the impact of both the movement of tectonic plates and El Nino on the state.  Chapter Six, \\"California, from Top to Bottom,\\" is a detailed look at the regions of the state, starting with the North Coast and Wine Country up north to the Inland Empire and Deserts of the South.  The major cities of San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego are covered as well.  California Politics is the subject for Chapter Seven, \\"Government and Politics,\\" where sharp-eyed readers will note that the music for \\"I Love You, California,\\" the state song, was written by A. F. Frankenstein.<br /><br />The economics that make California \\"A Wealthy State\\" are the province of Chapter Eight, which covers farming, manufacturing, mining, fishing, transportation, and communication.  The recipe for this book is Gazpacho, based on California's bounty of fresh vegetables (assuming you like a cool summer soup).  The citizens of the state are the topic for Chapter Nine, \\"The Faces of California,\\" the fastest growing developed area in the world.  Diversity and ethnic trends, as well as migrants and immigrants, are covered.  Finally, Chapter Ten, \\"Creations and Recreations,\\" begins with writers who have lived and worked in California, from Jack London, Mark Twain and John Steinbeck to Dashiell Hammett, Jack Kerouac, and Amy Tan.  Heinrichs wisely stays away from trying to include Hollywood in this chapter, but does touch on architecture, the performing arts, and team sports, ending the chapter talking about festivals and recreational activities.<br /><br />This last chapter underscores that Heinrichs is just scratching the surface on the topic of the state of California.  This volume has lots of full-color photographs, and maps on key subjects like natural resources and population density.  There is a Timeline that compress U.S. and California state history, along with several pages of Fast Facts filled with statistics.  If young students want To Find Out More there is a list of books, organizations, and Internet sites for further study.  Also, there are the accustomed sidebars that provide details on such interesting things as the Le Brea Tar Pits, Ronald Reagan, John Muir, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, and \\"Gag Me with a Spoon!\\"  Granted, this look at California only toucheson the rich history of the state, but as you would expect from this series it provides young students with a solid start.on the rich history of the state, but as you would expect from this series it provides young students with a solid start."	2005-08-31

What's he reading?  \\"Modesty Blaise.\\"<br /><br />Why would Vincent want to read Modesty Blaise?

Meet Modesty and her pal Willie and join them on their action-packed adventures, and you'll see why Tarantino worships Modesty, and why he (pretty obviously) patterned much of Uma Thurman's character \\"The Bride\\" after Modesty in the movie \\"Kill Bill.\\"  Modesty Blaise is the ultimate action heroine-- try this, her first adventure (in book form, anyway-- she'd been a comic book figure for awhile by the time this came out), and enjoy."	2005-08-31

A totally refreshing story set apart from the run of the mill cookie cut books that you find everyday in the stores. Admittingly, I dislike science fiction books, but this story was very pleasant to read. The best part about the book was the authors unbelievable talent in writing so realistically that you felt like you were a ghost right there beside the characters. The author also did a brilliant job of writing the character dialogue to add to the overall realism. The only bumps were the first couple chapters written a little awkwardly but after that it smoothes out and a few pages in the middle needed grammatical corrections. Overall, a fantastic read for all adults.	2005-08-31

But it just didn't feel very climactic for what seems like it ought to be the last book in the series.  Maybe if it hadn't been named \\"Crystal City\\" I'd have felt better about it being just a link in the chain.   <br />I also found myself scratching my head and wondering if I'd missed a book in between Heartfire and Crystal City.  There seems to have been at least a year in between the stories, which in any of itself isn't a problem except that they keep referring to things that happened - the death of a baby, Arthur's breakthrough, meeting Abe and Coz, rescuing a boatload of slaves, the splitting up of the Verily / Fink / Alvin / Arthur / Audobon crew, Peggy's acquaintence with Squirel and Moose... there seems to be a good book or two in there that we didn't get to read.   Maybe he will fill in some gaps later the way he's done with Ender's universe?   <br />Finally, the Crystal City story itself just didn't seem to be long enough.  There was so much going on that didn't really get much detail - especially the role of Abe, Coz, and Verily in getting the charter, the invasion of Mexico, Arthur's return, the journey north, etc.  It almost felt like some of those details were too boring to write about... but that doesn't make sense considering the time he spent on similar topics in \\"Journeyman\\" and even \\"Heartfire.\\"   <br />The book ended in such a way that we were left hopeful for another installment.  I certainly hope we get one: as a climax for a really great series, this just didn't fit the bill."	2005-08-31

Of the 32 London boroughs, 7 are missed out altogether and others are only partially covered.  With just one or two exceptions, only areas with an inner London postcode are included.  So areas in outer London such as Kingston-upon-Thames and Sutton in the south; Ruislip in the west; and Barnet in the north are in effect deemed not to exist.  Especially with the outer London boroughs now starting to enjoy something of a renaissance, I think this guide needs to rethink its policy.  It really needs to give readers a full and complete picture.  It would be a good start if it covered the outer areas in a little less detail than the better-known central ones, rather than not cover them at all. Buyers not familiar with it should bear in mind that London does not suddenly end where this guide leaves off. I'd suggest they investigate the outer area - it's often possbile to buy an identical property for virtually half the price of the inflated inner-London level by moving just three or four miles further out - ten miles out, say, rather than six. Local restaurants and coffee bars will often be branches of exactly the same chains as found in the inner areas (eg Pizza Express, Cafe Nero). Meanwhile, schools will be better and crime lower.	2005-08-31

The story line is excellent. There are real mysteries, dangers, and frustrations. In many ways, I liked it better than The Challenge (the training by sexual frustration in that one bothered me). But this book repeated too much of the first one, especially in the sex scenes; I could have interchanged the names and noticed no difference. Also, the resolution came too swiftly for all that went before. Otherwise, this book might have surpassed its predecessor. Certainly Zical's despair over Dora's climactic action was superbly written; I cried for several pages. But it was all resolved too abruptly, so allow the proper emotional responses to occur in the reader or even in the characters. All the elements were there; they just weren't handled as well as they could have been, leaving this reader unsatisfied with the result.	2005-08-31

The Bible is not Sexist	Although I am committed to the equality of women I am also a Christian and have had to listen to a steady stream of distorted teachings regarding the place of women in the church and in the world. Although I knew they were wrong I did not have the expertise to refute what churchmen (and women) were telling me the Bible said. Until I read SEXISM IS A SIN. <br /> <br />Talk about a revelation! The author is a biblical theologian who traces the development of sexist attitudes from the time of Abraham and Sarah to the time of St. Paul. Although the scholarship behind the book is obvious it is not written for academics. It is a fascinating and easy-to-read story of people and events who, throughout biblical times, ignored the call of Jesus and of the Latter Prophets who called for social justice, compassion and mercy. Instead, men continually choose to use violence and power-politics to get what they wanted and then blamed their brutality on God. <br /> <br />The author connects this insistence on violence to the development of a sexism that is determined to keep the female role of nuturing and care-giving confined to the home where it cannot interfere with the warrior mentality that operates in the larger world.	2005-08-31

"This book is NOT about global warming. At least, not directly about the global warming of the Industrial Age over which extremists from both environmental and industry/government groups loudly wrangle about.  Ruddiman's theme is global warming beginning far earlier -- 8000 years earlier.  His expertise is in paleoclimatology, study of the climate in long-past eras.  He presents a very persuasive case that starting about 8000 years ago, an increased \\"unnatural\\" output of carbon dioxide from early human agricultural endeavors began to measurably effect the earth's climate (with the effect intensified a few thousand years later by increased methane emissions from rice farming). It is Ruddiman's conclusion, very clearly presented and well supported with evidence, that this \\"extra\\" carbon dioxide has offset the \\"normal\\" global cooling that otherwise would have ended the present comfortable \\"interglacial\\" period and plunged us once again into an era of heavy glaciation.  In short, into yet another Ice Age.<br /><br />Ruddiman's work challenges us to jettison many comfortable myths, among them being that \\"Mother Earth\\" is naturally a stable benign guardian and that pre-industrial humans lived in some idyllic, low impact manner.<br /><br />Like \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\", this is a book that has fundamentally changed my perception of the distant past.  It is both an important book and a book that makes for fascinating reading.  I can scarcely recommend it too much.  My advice: Buy it.  Read it.  Think about it."	2005-08-31

I think most people would agree the guy was a knucklehead for doing what he did. However, the subject matter of a man living with bears and subsequently having his life taken by these same bears is fascinating.  It seemed fairly difficult to screw up a story written solely about this same subject.  As I read the book, I became so annoyed with the constant second guessing of  Mr. Treadwell's motives by Mr. Jans. Who cares?

On their way back from their mission, they are attacked by the Japanese, and the ship sinks. No one knows where they are, and they are not listed as being out--they are floating in the open sea, and fall prey to sharks, and in some cases, their own madness. Only 317 crew members were alive at the end of their five day ordeal.<br /><br />It's a book of courage, and a testament to the sailors. It's also a damming account of the ineptness of the US Navy in the worst naval disaster in US history.	2005-08-31

"Author and entertainment journalist Dorrie Williams-Wheeler has written an autobiography about her life entitled SPARKLEDOLL.COM: Reflections, Celebrity Interviews, and Behind the Scenes, with Author and Pop Culture Critic Dorrie Williams-Wheeler.  It is a compilation of her thoughts, actions, and experiences organized into diary entries, articles, short stories, and excerpts from her other books. She begins the book by informing the reader that she wears many hats; writer, designer, critic, and ends the book with several random thoughts on a variety of topics. It has a conversational tone and reads like a personal diary, moving through subjects such as weight loss, childbirth, and the processes involved with writing a novel.  Additionally, she shares how she transitioned from screenwriter to published author and entertainment journalist.<br /><br />SPARKLEDOLL.COM also includes a chapter on the concept to conception details of various websites she has operated over the years and why she started them, such as imissthe80s.com.  Williams-Wheeler was feeling nostalgic for the 80's and couldn't find an 80's site that had everything she wanted, so she started one.  She is still into musicians such as Duran Duran, The Go Go's, The Bangles, and Billy Idol.  This was surprising because I thought she would have been into more African-American artists like LL Cool J and Kool Moe Dee from that time period, but she does mention En Vogue.  The book also includes celebrity interviews taken from her website thabiz.com with Cassidy, Towanda Braxton, Talib Kweli, JoJo, and Nivea; many of whom I had never heard of, so it may be a regional thing.  The interviews would've made a good addition, but were a bit repetitious and boring.<br /><br />SPARKLEDOLL.COM is a one-of-a-kind book.  Williams-Wheeler truly wrote in her own voice, and followed her own rules, and to quote her, \\"I wrote the book the way I talk.\\" Unfortunately, I found the topics and organization hard to follow, the writing style extremely distracting and somewhat sporadic, and the dialects and slang used confusing.  If edited and structured properly, this would be a good book for young high school girls looking to experience the ups and downs of being an entertainment journalist or possibly those who are huge fans of the 1980's.<br /><br />Reviewed by Ashanti<br /><br />for The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersthe writing style extremely distracting and somewhat sporadic, and the dialects and slang used confusing.

As she nears the food tent, a bomb goes off.  Kate is okay.  The next frightening thing to happen is that Kate's best friend Jordan found a lump in her breast and wants Kate there for the biopsy.<br /><br />She immediately takes the first plane to Boston and finds herself having sex with Dylan, Jordan's sexy police detective brother.  She leaves Boston without seeing him again and is almost run over by someone in the parking lot. She is then lured to a warehouse where a bomb goes off.  Jordan sends Dylan down to keep her friend safe.  Both Dylan and the local police believe someone is targeting Kate but to her knowledge, she has no enemies and wants nothing more than for him to go back home.  He is determined to see she remains safe because the ladies man has met his match in Kate.  They learn that her great uncle left her $80 million dollars, money that her three greedy male cousins expected to inherit.  Some people would kill for that kind of inheritance; her cousins have eighty million motives to kill Kate.<br /><br />Nobody can doubt that Julie Garwood is one of the best romantic suspense writers today.  Her heroine is feisty, vulnerable and independent while Dylan is protective, caring and determined to make Kate admit her feelings for him.  Some of their discussions are truly funny and gets the reader sidetracked from wondering which one of the cousins or their associates want Kate dead.

No matter how you look at it, it is hard to imagine how such pile of nonsense was put together.     At times the sheer stupidity of the plot, characters and situations make you smile in wonder. (The book's only entertaining value).     One of the novel's action scenes is located in the cramped, deadly steep, badly kept staircase of Seville's Giralda. Needless to say, the best well-known fact about the Giralda is that it does not have an staircase (the moorish king that ordered its construction decided instead on ramps, allegedly so that he could ride his horse to the top). All in all, this is possibly one of the best researched and credible passages in the book.  At least he seems to know something about stairs, which is not the case for most other subjects he touches.    You can imagine the rest.	2005-08-31

The gentle watercolor illustrations emphasize the gentle theme of this story.  However, the watercolors may prove distracting for some readers as people are given more of a blurred appearance and often seem to be part of the background scenery.  Many people with autism have difficulty decoding facial expressions and this \\"blurring\\" effect could add to that confusion.  Certain colors appear to be associated with certain emotions, such as the orange when one is angry.  I didn't like the orange shadings at all.<br /><br />While I didn't care for the orange faces, I loved the message and the subject of the story.  While Sammy appeared to fade into some of the scenery, I did not get the impression that the tired \\"autistic people prefer their own worlds\\" myth was being reinforced.  People with autism often have difficulty processing and responding to sensory stimuli and often find it overwhelming.  Responses can range from very intense to seemingly nonexistent, at which times the person is \\"coming even\\" after having endured an onslaught of sensory input.<br /><br />Sam's older brother is the narrator of this story and outlines the parallels of a routine day for him and for Sammy.  The boys' mother's unending refrain is that her younger son \\"is special.\\"  Even so, Sam's brother yearns for ways he can include him in their play and even wishes they attended the same school.  My favorite picture (probably because I feel it is the most accurate) is Sammy's look of intense concentration when he is watching the sand sift through his fingers.<br /><br />Sam's speech is mostly echolalic and his brother wishes they could converse.  Still, he is very accepting of Sam and very protective of him as well.<br /><br />I got tired of the mother's saying \\"because he is special\\" over and over and also wished more time was spent on describing autism and explaining what it is.  Autism is a neurobiological condition that affects sensory processing and integration and communication.  Autism is as varied as there are individuals who have it.

Just about anybody with enough time on their hands can deconstruct anything.  All you need is: <br /> <br />1)  A receptive audience <br />2)  A cursory (at best) understanding of the subject-matter <br />3)  A conspiracy theory <br /> <br />The standard approach to deconstruction is to search the mass of data and commentary on your target subject for a few pieces of information  that support the position that the audience wants to hear, while ignoring everything that contradicts that position.  This only works if the target audience is at least slightly more ignorant than the author.  Then of course one needs a conspiracy theory to explain why everyone who actually studies the subject for a living disagrees with the author. <br /> <br />So we have Kevin Trudeau with an audience of sick people, no medical training, and a conspiracy theory linking the government and the pharmaceutical industry.  We have the Swift Boat Veterans with their audience of angry Republicans, made-up biography of John Kerry, and an imagined liberal media conspiracy.  We have the Flat Earth Society with an audience of cranks, a fairly complete misunderstanding of astronomy, and a global scientific conspiracy to push the anti-biblical notion that the Earth is round (yes, the Bible says the Earth is flat).  And don't forget the Holocaust deniers with a receptive audience of anti-semites, bogus historical information, and a conspiracy theory too sordid to mention. <br /> <br />The list goes on and on -- The Moon Landing Hoaxers, OJ, and now Jonathan Wells.   Wells's audience is obviously fundamentalist Christians, his understanding of evolution is poor (see [...] and the conspiracy involves the scientific community, comprising thousands of individual in various disciplines, located all around the world. <br /> <br />The problem is that, while deconstruction is easy, science is hard.  Jobs and funding in science are extremely hard to come by, and competition among scientists is fierce.  No idea is even considered unless it is supported by copious evidence, and even then it is subjected to ruthless scrutiny in peer-reviewed forums.  There is simply no way that a massive, worldwide conspiracy could succeed in such an environment. <br /> <br />In short, medicine is useful, Kerry served honorably in Vietnam, the Earth is round, the Holocaust happened, and evolution is a fact.  If you really want to learn about the history of life on this planet, pick up a book by Dawkins or Mayr.  But don't waste your time with this silliness.	2005-08-31

The whole series must contain that many.<br /><br />I own 3 books in this series. The Southern Appalachian, the Virginias, and the Mid-Atlantic States guide. I have found these books to be a great aid in planning hikes, especially 2-3 day backpacking trips. Since most of these hikes are either one-way or round trip (as opposed to circuit hikes) you either need to have two cars or plan on seeing the same sites twice. I'm not saying this is a bad thing, but other books have better circuit hikes.<br /><br />This series IS very informative, not only with regards to the actually hike, but also the history both natural and otherwise of the area you are hiking in.<br /><br />I have not used this edition as much as I have the other 2 guides that I own in this series, but it did come in handy during a spur of the moment trip to NC/TENN.  The maps could be a little better, as they are topographical maps with a green line for the trail.. They are adequate, but I've seen better.<br /><br />All 45 hikes come with a description, a map, an elevation profile, and an itinerary, as well as various other information.<br /><br />When planning for a hike I do tend to use this book in conjunction with other books, but I usually take this book (or copies of the pages) on the actual hike itself. The fact that the pages are so small allows for easier handling and storage of the laminated pages during the trip.<br /><br />So if you enjoy hiking and are near the AT while in the 'Southern Appalchians', you may want to take a look at this book. It is well worth the money.	2005-08-31

Kingston Phillips is an entertainment executive based in Chicago who has carved her way into the industry, nabbing one of the top rappers for her new division and garnering the respect of her boss.  All is lining up well for Kingston, and she has two good friends who share in her happiness and a kinda-sorta boyfriend in the wings.  Or so it seems.  Just as things start running smoothly, her grandmother dies, and she must return to Jamaica for the funeral.  In addition, she finds out some things about her boyfriend that make her realize she's better off without him.<br /><br />While in Jamaica, memories overtake Kingston as she deals with the death and funeral arrangements, her situation back home, and the decisions she has to make regarding her future.  She encounters family drama with those who should be closest to her and is forced to relive events of the past, including tragedy and heartache.  Kingston also finds out that her grandmother has named her the executor of her estate.  This causes more stress between the family members, and Kingston is left to decide how she will proceed with her sanity intact.  Kingston has much soul-searching to do as she later finds out her grandmother not only made her executor of her estate, but with the request that Kingston return to Jamaica and live in the house so she can oversee the estate fund.  Added to the chaos is the fact that her ex-boyfriend lives in town, and he's trying to pick up where they left off in their relationship.  Kingston must decide what she will do professionally, personally, and romantically, but it is all easier said than done.<br /><br />Though the novel is fiction, it touches on many aspects of other genres such as romance, a bit of suspense, and a bit of drama found in relationship-type novels.  There is something for everyone.  The writing isn't overly complicated, the characters are well-structured, and portions of the book were so moving, I found myself feeling as if I were part of the cast and actually going through the ups and downs featured in the book.

I was too young during Beatlemania, but I felt the author did a pretty good job writing about it. I particularly enjoyed some of the newspaper stories about the reaction of young fans. The one thing I thought needed some improvement was the editing in the first half of the book.  <br /> <br />My son took an immediate liking to the book. I suppose having the word 'Teenager' on the title makes him feel like it's just for him. To my surprise he read in in just a few days. As he was reading the book, he would comment or ask a question. Also, as he was reading, he listened to some of the songs that were discussed in the book.

They take the opportunity and time to put forth the obvious fact that SAHARA is a work of FICTION in the grand fashion of James Bond, Indiana Jones and (heaven forbid) Star Trek. These types of novels spin together elements of history, science, imagination and good-old heart stopping action with the objectives of entertaining the reader and maybe, just maybe, encouraging that same reader to go out and research a few of the more interesting points in NON-FICTION works.  <br /> <br />I have taken more trips, visited more museums and researched more topics after reading about places and events in works of FICTION then for any other reason. Numerous physicists, chemists and other scientists have said that the primary reason they are who they are is because they wanted to see if they could create what they read about in science-FICTION books, where do you think the flip-phone came from, Capt Kirk ring a bell (pun intended). So before critiquing a literary work of FICTION for what it isn't, enjoy it for what it is and if you want to experience a non-stop, 576 page roller coaster ride of action and adventure with a side car of romance read SAHARA and maybe your next vacation will be a little of the same.

Again, if you knit or are contemplating it, buy the knit along as well, you will have a more richer and rewarding experience! <br />     Also, I plan on knitting up one of each of the 3 squares in the back of the Knit Along for the charity Warm Up America! project this week (before I start any new projects), I hope everyone else that gets these books does the same, especially in light of therecent Hurricane that has ravaged the south, I know they will need warm blankets and comfort."	2005-08-31

Also, you kind of have to suspend belief...with so much going on in this town you're like \\"the press never caught on to this?\\" (like when the teenagers on the hill disappeared...then reappeared).

As you are reading this book, questions pop up that you would have probably never thought of. Set in the not so distant future, Bradbury plunges you into the life of Guy Montag. He is a fireman who was always taught to ask how, not why. His job is to burn, not put out flames, never asking the reasons behind the burnings. He goes through life happy, not knowing anything is wrong. He lives in an unperfected utopia. Due to one event, his whole mentality crumbles and chaos emerges as he goes through a transformation, making everyone around him his enemy, except the few people who have gone through this metamorphosis. No longer ignorant he becomes isolated, pushing for some way out.  <br />This book is probably one of the best books I have ever read; it might even be my favorite. If you like books such as The Giver, or the short story Harrison Bergeron, then this is definitely a book to read.  <br />	2005-08-31

With a plan in mind, Nicolette travels to Baraka pretending to be her sister, with the idea that she'll go there, meet the King, and try to back out of the agreement, only to find that she only has two weeks to get ready for the wedding and the man she was supposed to marry was unlike any man she has ever met or been with. But things aren't as she expects.<br /><br />Malik knows who Nic is when she walks off the ship, but it amuses him to let her play her game and see what she comes up with next. For each request she has, he has a counter request, with the end being the same -- she will marry him when the time comes and their marriage will be a real marriage -- not one just on paper. But will Nic go through with the marriage, and what happens when she finds out it was all a setup, that there never was a marriage agreement between her sister and Malik? Was that just a plan Malik devised to get her to come to him?<br /><br />THE SULTAN'S BOUGHT BRIDE is a wickedly fun read! The chemistry between Nic and Malik is red-hot and scorching! Nic is an independent woman determined not to follow the rules of old, and Malik is determined to win her at all costs.

If only America, with all her abundant resources would join in... But in the meantime, the Reavlry brothers, Joseph and Matthew, continue with their determined hunt for the Peacemaker, a powerful and dangerous foe who is repsonsible for their parents murder and who has a mad scheme to bring about a peace between England and Germany that would only tarnish England's honour with her current allies.  <br /> <br />Joseph, however, soon finds himself once again in the quiet countryside of Cambridgeshire, when he gets injured while trying to rescue a soldier from no man's land. Once home again, Joseph finds himself, unexpectedly, couseling a very inept vicar as well as providing comfort for the many women of the village who have lost their husbands and sons. That is until a weapons scientist, Theo Blaine, is  found brutally and viciously murdered in his garden. Rumours run rampant that there is a German spy in the village and the he has murdered Blaine in order to stop the work he was doing. But, while assissting the police in their investigations, Joseph discovers that Blaine was a man with quite a few secrets. Was Blaine murdered by a spy or was he murdered because of his secrets? Once again, Joseph finds himself in the middle of a perplexing murder investigation... <br /> <br />\\"Angels in the Gloom\\" truly was a riveting read. The storyline was divided into two subplots -- one dealing with brother Matthew's efforts to thwart the nefarious schemes of a beautiful Irish spy who is in league with the Peacemaker, and the other to do with Joseph's hunt for Blaine's murderer. Both are very well done and full of suspense and intrigue. But what really made this novel a fantastic read was how Anne Perry developed the motif of the women who were left behind -- the wives and mothers who faced the fears that they would never see their menfolk again and the hurt they felt over the fact that their husbands were keeping part of themselves from them. And this was mavellously encapsulated in the manner in which Perry depicted what Hannah, the married Reavlry sister experienced. Her confusion over the way things were changing socially as well as the anguish and resentment she felt because her family would keep things secret from her. And it was this heart-rendering motif that made \\"Angels in the Gloom\\" something out of the ordinary and well worth recommending as an excellent read."	2005-08-31

I found the work interesting as a quick read, though certainly not a useful reference work.<br /><br />The initial hero of Griffiths' work is Pierre Boulez, who in post-war Paris was certain that the twelve-tone method of Schoenberg and (even more so) Webern was the future of music, and by relentlessly publishing and composing Boulez was trying himself to make it turn out that way. After speaking something about the French composer's post-war worldview, the author presents the 1950s development of the Darmstadt school, when Boulez was joined at the forefront by Stockhausen and Nono, with important contributions by Cage and Barraque. At the same time, the \\"classic modernism\\" of Babbitt and Carter was flourishing. The 1960s and 1970s is shown as six waves, these being the use of quotation, music theatre, politics, virtuosity and improvisation, computer music, and minimalism. Ligeti, Xenakis, Cardew, Reich, Messiaen get the most attention here. The chapter on the 1980s and 1990s gets the title \\"Many Rivers\\" and discusses Schnittke, Rihm, Part, Kurtag, Gubaidulina, Ferneyhough, Feldman, Birtwistle, and Berio among others.<br /><br />As is probably inevitable in such a work, some important people are left out. Per Norgard, whose infinity series is one of the most innovative concepts of contemporary music, is missing, as is Magnus Lindberg, who established himself as Finland's foremost young composer with \\"Kraft\\" in 1986. Lutoslawski is simply inexplicably absent. Sofia Gubaidulina scandously gets only about a page. However, Griffiths was prescient in including Tan Dun, who was little known then but is increasingly popular now. Another failing of the book is that for reasons of space, most composers only get a few paragraphs, and really, if you already own recordings of a given composer's work, the musicological essays in the CD notes are probably more substantial than anything you'll find here.<br /><br />MODERN MUSIC AND AFTER is worth flipping through for any fan of contemporary music, but I think that it works better as a historical document than as a useful resource for said fans to learn more about the music they love.most composers only get a few paragraphs, and really, if you already own recordings of a given composer's work, the musicological essays in the CD notes are probably more substantial than anything you'll find here. <br /> <br />MODERN MUSIC AND AFTER is worth flipping through for any fan of contemporary music, but I think that it works better as a historical document than as a useful resource for said fans to learn more about the music they love."	2005-08-31

Living in a country that had been overtaken by the Russians in what they called \\"the puppet regime\\", one couldn't imagine that life could get worse in this destitute country, ravaged by war and poverty. \\"The bleeding wound\\" Gorbachav called it.  <br />  Zoya's graphic, heroic and saddening story told with such detail brings you to a life, I would say you \\"could just imagine\\", but I can't imagine that life. orphaned at a young age, under two controlling fundamentalist Moslem regimes, life in Afghanistan only seems to grow worse. Under the control of the Taliban, you will read of the most inhumane, torturous treatment. The taking of lives. I always knew how awful the Taliban was, but I never knew from an individual's personal experience what it was REALLY like to live there.  <br />  This incredible young woman has done so much for the woman and people of Afghanistan, helping refugees, teaching women to read and write in a country where 90% of the women are illiterate, spreading the words of freedom, where her life can be taken at any time. Zoya is a true hero and inspiration.  <br />  There is one line in the book that I will never forget, and I believe it is how Zoya truelly loves and feels for her country. It is a line from an old Afghan folklore \\"I am ready to die for my love, but I want my love to be ready to die for my country.\\" This is the passion Zoya lives with on her crusade to make life better for people in Afghanistan."	2005-08-31

In fact, it doesn't even really provide any real cures. But then again, the reality is that if cures could be found in over-the-counter supplements or home remedies summed up conveniently in books, everyone would have been cured by now (right?). And the whole argument that the FDA or any other federal organization is conspiring to keep people hooked onto prescription drugs is old hat, not to mention highly convenient. Trudeau makes sweeping claims about products that have never been scientifically studied or verified for efficacy, and uses red herrings in order to divert the reader's attention away from these major deficits.  The book fails to provide any concrete substantiation of any of its claims. Furthermore, the fact that one is alerted to the possibility of subscribing to a commercial website to obtain further information is suggestive of the possibility that the book is merely an advertising vehicle for the author's (numerous) business ventures. The author was banned by the FTC in 2004 from making any more advertisements for unsubstantiated products, on television or otherwise.  The only redeeming quality of this book is its overall message that traditional medicines aren't your only alternatives. But to jump from that to making a claim that \\"they don't want you to know\\" [how to cure yourself], the \\"they\\" being the \\"medical establishment\\", is ridiculous and completely misleading.  However, if you do have a serious medical condition, especially something like liver or heart disease, cancer, diabetes, etc., don't buy this book- or any material like it- because it really does not provide you any cures. Talk to your doctor, talk to friends, talk to people who have gone through what you are going through, become a wise consumer and become an expert about your own body. Being well informed (and that means NOT being misled) will allow you to make better decisions about your health.

For the most part, the story is anything but similar to this long standing popular novel. The main characters are very one-dimensional and most importantly, although it presumably is part of the science-fantasy genre, the story makes many outrageous and implausable errors relative to the natural sciences of geology and biology (an ice age 12,000 years ago that began over a few days instead of millenia, tapping the energy of the earth's molten core to melt the ice of Antartica). There is so much hokum in this book that I soon got tired of following the main characters as they wended their way through the  vast and immense chambers within the giant pyramid built by the ancient Atlanteans in what is now Antartica. The only similarity to Brown's novels is that the author got the Vatican mixed up in this mess. If I were on this trek I would have chipped out of the ice some of those long ago frozen Atlanteans and not only checked them over for their dress and other artifacts to learn something about their culture, and also analysed their DNA to compare it to modern day peoples.

Through the killer's eyes, she \\"sees\\" a murder taking place, even though it's something that will happen, not something that has happened yet. With the few clues she gets, Lauren travels to Foothills Guest Ranch in Borland, Alberta, where she hopes to be able to find the lady she saw in her vision.<br /><br />Cal Taggart is the owner of the ranch Lauren is visiting. He's an ex-bullrider who is in danger of losing his ranch and to help save it he opened a dude ranch. It's something he hates to do but to keep from losing the ranch, he'll do it. Sparks fly as soon as Lauren and Cal meet, but Cal is leery of letting anyone get close after his disaster of a marriage and all the unlucky happenings going on with the ranch.<br /><br />Lauren doesn't know what to think when the lady in her vision turns out to be someone close to Cal, his ex-wife. Should she tell him what she saw or keep quiet and try to figure out who the murderer is herself, since no one has ever believed her when she's spoken of her vision? And despite getting close to Cal, will she lose him when her secret comes out?<br /><br />LAUREN'S EYES is an engrossing story that had me captivated from the first page to the last. It had all that I look for in a book -- a strong heroine, a hero who just oozed charm, and a mystery that needed to be solved. Throw in some hot sex and I'm not even sorry that I didn't get to bed last night until 5 in the morning. Fast-paced and keeping you on the edge of your seat to know what happens next, LAUREN'S EYES is one not to be missed. :) Ms. Wilson packs quite a punch in this tale and I look forward to reading her again.<br /><br />Mad"	2005-08-31

Rashid is a 23 year old, inner-city gay male who knows what he wants and how to get it, which basically means by any way possible.  However, Rashid soon realizes that the one thing he really wants most in life is the love of a good man.<br /><br />The lust of Rashid's life is Troy.  I use the word lust and not love intentionally. Rashid thinks he's in love with Troy, but it doesn't keep him from jumping into bed with a long-time crush. He will do anything to keep Troy from not finding out, including murder. Rashid lives in the fast lifestyle of gay Philadelphia where he participates in unprotected sex with various partners and schemes for fast money. He lives in a world of self-doubt and insecurity and only wants someone to love him. After the breakup with Troy, Rashid meets Calvin, an 18 year old high school student, who brings the love that Rashid so desperately desires. Calvin comes with baggage which includes baby mama drama and sexual liaisons with different partners.<br /><br />Smoking Cigarettes was well-intentioned and character driven. The plot had many twists and turns with dramatic flair. The flow of the story was hard to follow at times because there were just too many characters to keep up with. I found myself flipping back and forth throughout the story because new characters were constantly being introduced. It was as if I was reading a tabloid story rather than a novel. Hall tried to portray a realistic gay lifestyle, but it confused the plot and the reader. Many of the supporting characters could have been eliminated.  With that aside, I liked Rashid's story. He was similar to Winter from the Coldest Winter Ever. Rashid and Winter were both connivers and schemers who suffered from self-doubt and insecurity. Their lives were filled with constant drama and brand-new schemes on every page. Rashid's  life was a new drama every time I turned the page. He was on an unending search for a new audience to entertain. Rashid's underlying insecurity sparked deep depression and never-ending questions of self-worth. The bouts of depression he endured were throughout the story.  He just couldn't figure out that he was his own worst enemy.<br /><br />Reviewed by Richell Winchester<br /><br />for The RAWSISTAZ Reviewersing search for a new audience to entertain.

Kirchen's first published novel, but its gives promise of more to come. If the coin of the realm in American culture is a certain stomach for violence, then this novel not only takes the edge off the appetite, it changes the savor of the taste buds. There is violence in the book, but not the rush and thrill of watching it happen. The perspective is not that of the perpetrator or the spectator, but that of the survivors. They have a hard time reaching each other through the inevitable pain that comes of violence, but if you are a survivor, or even if you only know any survivors, this novel will reach you. <br /> <br />The nice thing about the way this story gets to you is that you will enjoy the process. There is mystery - like a murder mystery, except that not only do you not know \\"who done it,\\" you're not even sure that there was a murder. There is romance, but nothing like the needy female swooning for Adonis. There is smart and witty dialogue, convincing, never forced. If you can anticipate these conversations, you should be writing yourself.   <br />  <br />The story is the first person narrative of Amy Stuart, a woman who has learned the hard way to be strong and assertive, without having lost her vulnerability or her susceptibility to personal tragedy. She is a writer to boot. The male role is withdrawn and superior - a famous author. Elizabeth Barrett and Mr. Darcy come to mind, but not in the way they are reprised in \\"You've Got Mail\\" or \\"Diary of Bridget Jones.\\" This author (Kirchen, through her proxy Amy)  has a refreshing voice of her own.

Graves, a professor of Evolutionary Biology, explains in THE RACE MYTH precisely why Americans insist that race does exist even though genetically, as human beings, we are pretty much the same. The exception are differences caused by geography or environment. Examples we have all heard are the genetic diseases that certain \\"races\\" are more susceptible to such as sickle cell anemia in black people. He showed that although the people of Syria and Ghana don't look alike, they share they sickle cell gene and malaria. Kenyans and Ghanaians do resemble each other but the similarities end there. The Kenyans don't have the sickle cell gene, which is a defense mechanism against malaria, because in the high altitudes of Kenya, there are few mosquitoes and none carrying malaria. This is an example of how environment and geography play an important part in genetics.<br /><br />He explains that the race myth exists in America as an outgrowth of European dominance. When they first landed in the New World, they sought aid and advice from the indigenous people but that quickly faded as they decided to take the land from the previous owners. In addition, they began to import stolen Africans to cultivate the large tracts of land in their search for wealth. In order to make the system work, they had to establish the idea of \\"race\\" and along with that, the notion of superiority and inferiority. The Europeans were of superior intelligence, Indians down a notch and Africans on the bottom. According to Graves, this structuring of \\"race\\" is actually a social construct to maintain control. These ideas have persisted and are obvious in the distribution of employment, education and wealth in America. He goes on further to explore the myth that African Americans are more athletically inclined than European Americans including the history of the NBA and how and when African Americans began to \\"dominate\\" that sport.<br /><br />In conclusion, Graves calls for each of us to do our part in dismantling this social construct and to work for justice and equality. While he admits that everyone will not read or heed this book, history has shown that even small groups can bring about change and he urges us to do our part.<br /><br />Even though I've been hearing that race was a social construct, I have never seen it broken down and explained so thoroughly. Graves does an excellent job of giving us the scientific facts with the social examples to back his arguments. He demonstrates time and again how similar we are as human beings. He explains the so called gap in African American and European American scores on tests such as the SAT, the LSAT and the GRE, which are used to determine which students go to what college or university. He explores the poverty, the under funded educational systems that exist in this country and how that affects the outcomes. He does a marvelous job of showing how this is by design and not by accident. He most definitely takes the authors of The Bell Curve, Herrnstein and Murray, to task for reenergizing the claim that genetics explained the differences in test scores. I would recommend this book for all thinking human beings.<br /><br />Reviewed by alice Holman<br /><br />of the RAWSISTAZReviewersart in dismantling this social construct and to work for justice and equality.

"I was born in Korea to a Korean mother and an American father.  I love cooking Korean food and my friends and husband enjoy eating it. Ms. Hepinstall seems to be using what my family calls \\"city\\" or fancy recipes.  Many of her foods do not have the \\"country\\" flavor that I am used to from the port city PoHang.  BUT, the recipes are wonderful.   I would recommend this book to seasoned cooks and patient students.  While you can simplify some of her dishes, many are authentic and delicious.  She loves using walnuts and the fancy sil kochu (which my family did not)- I leave those out often and just use coarse Korean red crushed pepper and taste no difference.  Like all good cooks, you have to take her recipe and make it your own by experimenting.  I love the pictures and the stories that accompany this book.     I own 8 Korean cookbooks - some in Hangul.  This one by far is the book that most consistently yields good results.  I had commented on this book when I first purchased it and gave it 4 stars.  After years of use, I have to boost it one more star. There is nothing better than this out there.     If you want a simpler book that keeps authentic flavors alive, I recommend Dok Suni.

As someone who studied under Stanley Payne, another great scholar of World War II, I appreciate Weinberg's intellectual rigor, his ability to balance objectivity without in the least abandoning his morality (a surprisingly rare feat in modern academia) and his clear and compelling prose.  <br /> <br />This book examines a subject which has not, surprisingly, been examined before in much detail: what the ideal post-war would have looked like to eight of the principal war leaders. It is a fast, exciting read. Suffice it to say that everyone in the world is better off that the war ended the way it did. <br /> <br />I think Professor Weinberg is too charitable toward FDR (Stewart Alsop, who was a cousin of FDR, once said that FDR would have been disturbed to see the erosion of WASP control of America and that is reinforced here by his vision of the UK remaining a superpower after the loss of its colonies), but one can disagree with the good professor's conclusions precisely because he is so scrupulously honest and thorough.	2005-08-31

Lily King writes beautifully and with amazing insight into the psychology of her characters,in particular,Vida,who must face the truth of her past because her avoidance and denial no longer work. Vida, a single mother with a teenage son, marries a recent widower with three children. I was intrigued by the relationships, reactions and emotions of these characters and felt connected to them throughout the novel. The backdrop of the Iranian Hostage Crisis was a powerful metaphor, and the references to Tess of the D'Urbervilles make me want to reread that book next. <br /> <br />	2005-08-31

This powerful story draws readers into the lives of its characters causing us to care deeply about the outcome. Ms. Park delicately and perhaps intuitively probes the individual characteristics of domination, courage and fortitude.

In fact, synthetics so thoroughly replaced gunpowder that what was once gunpowder is differentiated from its replacements by the term \\"black powder\\" while synthetics have taken over the germ gunpowder.   <br /> <br />Beginning with its invention and use by the Chinese, who first used gunpowder in an early version of (ineffective) hand grenades, through its first effective use in bombards in Europe, until it became the staple for small arms in the early modern period of history Kelly presents an interesting narrative history on how gunpowder impacted the world.  Although there is a technological deterministic aspect to the book (a natural result of the subject) the book does do a good job of putting gunpowder into context - in some cases gunpowder drives further military developments, in others the refinement of gunpowder is driven by other needs.  This book is especially interesting if you have any interest in the concept of \\"military revolution.\\"  It focuses on one type of tool over a 900 year period, which allows you to see how one technology evolved, and was integrated into the transformation of war, over a significant period of time."	2005-08-31

As the author himself says in the introduction, this book is neither an introduction to Islam or to be considered an historical piece.  It is meant to inform the reader on certain aspects of Islam and the Crusades that the author thinks have been left out of public discourse.    <br /> <br />As said before, the book is clear and concise.  The chapters themselves are organized into sections of text that have bold headings.  The bold heading tells the reader what exactly that section is about.  Most of these bold headings consist of what the author calls a PC myth.  Also, interspersed throughout the book are dialogue boxes that have interesting tidbits and information.  For example, there are boxes with the heading \\"A Book You're Not Supposed to Read\\" which consists of, you guessed it, books the author thinks you should read.  Other interesting dialogue boxes spaced through the book display the sayings of Muhammad and Jesus side by side so the reader can compare them to each other.  In the back of the book a notes section gives the sources the author used. <br /> <br />In the end, The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (and the Crusades) is an enlightening book that readers should pick up.  The author's use of original sources (i.e. Qur'an, Islamic teachings and writings) and logic makes for a convincing case that almost everything you have heard needs to be reexamined. <br />"	2005-08-31

While Kara seeks a brownstone for them to live in, their teenage daughter Lindsay objects as she expects to be named the high school head cheerleader; besides why would she leave suburbia and her friends for the dirty city.<br /><br />A psychopath recently burned down the home of Patrick Shields, a Marshall neighbor, killing his wife and two daughters.

"In recent years there has been an enormous explosion of interest in Gnostic Christian texts such as \\"The Gospel of Thomas\\" and \\"The Gospel of Mary Magdalene\\".  Almost overlooked in this fascination with early, non-canonical (i.e., omitted from the Bible) Christian texts has been The Didache (\\"The Teaching\\"), a \\"training manual\\" for Gentile converts to an early Jewish-Christian community.  (Most scholars date \\"The Didache\\" to about 90-120 A.D., but Milovec opts for an earlier date between 50-80 A.D.) <br /> <br />\\"The Didache\\" is a manual of initiation, not theology, but Milovec attempts to read between the lines to discern glimpses of the underlying theology.  Although Milovec's speculations sometime stray a bit too far from the available evidence, I think he is basically correct in seeing \\"The Didache\\" as reflecting a Jewish-Christian community who viewed Jesus primarily in prophetic and messianic terms, and not as the literal God incarnate of later Christian theology.  Of particular interest in this context are the eucharistic prayers found in \\"The Didache,\\" prayers which do not reflect the \\"this is my body  . . . this is my blood\\" phraseology of the New Testament sources.  Also, \\"The Didache\\" provides perhaps the earliest specific Christian condemnation of abortion, and reiterates the Pauline critique of homosexuality (or, at least, one form of it, characterized as \\"the corruption of boys\\").  Thus \\"The Didache\\" perhaps has relevance to today's \\"What would Jesus say?\\" debates.  <br /> <br />What gives \\"The Didache\\" credibility to me is its absence of Gnostic influence and its general similarity in language to the gospels, \\"The Acts of the Apostles,\\" and the \\"Letter of James\\".  In fact, it's emphasis on morality and its absence of high Christology (Jesus as God, Jesus as atoning for the sins of the world), seems to place it in the Jamesian tradition stemming from the Jewish Christian community centered in Jerusalem.  <br /> <br />In my opinion (and that of most scholars), the Gnostic gospels are relatively late 2nd century creations that tell us little about Jesus or his earliest group of followers.  \\"The Didache\\" provides a better window into that world, and I recommend it highly.  Milovec loses one star for a little bit of over-speculation and for a writing style that is not particularly captivating.  Still, he gets four stars for a basically solid book (supported with the original Greek text and ample-but-not-exhausting discussion of translation issues) that casts needed light on an early Christian text that has been too often neglected."	2005-08-31

Wolfe is clever, and he gives us some scathing commentary on American culture.  However, the book has two major problems:  First, he oversimplifies his targets. Second, there's a mean streak that strikes one as the curmudgeonly rantings of a man fully rooted in a mythical American past.<br /><br />It's easy for Wolfe to make fun of trends in psychology, sociobiology, linguistics, and \\"cultural relativity\\" when he puts them through a definitional strainer so thin that only the barest outline of the original theory remains.  Yet, that's what Wolfe does as he dumbs them down, and then calls them bogus.  It's dishonest criticism. He oversimplifies deconstructionism, psychoanalysis, biology, multiculturalism, and other topics so much that I continually reacted along the lines of \\"But that's not what those theories say!\\"  Additionally, as another reviewer mentioned, his objections are neither original nor aware of recent modifications.  However much one detests deconstruction (which he derides as some sort of new Communism), his simplistic approach is not only unfair, but ignores the ways in which it has influenced other political, linguistic, and social \\"discourse.\\"  Wolff seems such a Francophobe that one imagines him ordering \\"Freedom Fries\\" to this day. In addition, Wolfe himself has a long and noble history of deconstructing \\"texts,\\" including his own re-workings of the \\"New Yorker\\" in two essays here.<br /><br />For a man who seems to reject the post-modern idea that \\"history is written by the winners,\\" Wolfe spends an inordinate amount of time protecting and promoting his reputation. His reaction to critiques by Mailer, Updike, and Irving, although some of it deserving, comes off as incredibly puerile, and he proclaims that his naturalist reportage (as opposed to their brand of writing) is the style and model for the new century.  (At least, he credits Zola, Dreiser and others for their work.)  As he gleefully attempts to wittily bring down these \\"Eastern establishment\\" literary emblems; one thinks he doth protest too much.  His early pieces on \\"The New Yorker\\" are sometimes clever and quite nuanced, but he spoils the effect by telling us how clever and nuanced these were.  After reading Wolfe's enthusiasm for his own work, the pieces no longer meet our heightened expectations.<br /><br />The title piece on youthful sexual practices is well written, but neither very insightful nor particularly useful:  Wolfe has a knack for the revealing quote and the economical vignette, but whether these are true or representative is hard to know. At least \\"Hooking Up\\" is interesting and provocative without the defensive or self-promotional aspects of some of his other essays.  He also writes some interesting pieces about technology and society, although again, his speculations about the future are just too easy for him to knock down.  The essays are so scattered and varied that his sarcasm, exaggeration, and critical satire are often indistinguishable from his own vaunted objective \\"naturalistic\\" reporting.  Is he putting us on, or has he really become such a social science \\"Luddite\\" and prude? (I suspect the latter, but maybe, David Bowie-like, his newfound crank-stance is just a temporary persona.)  The man who dislikes notions of relativity and subjectivism doesn't appear to recognize that he himself reports the \\"facts\\" from a highly subjective and rightward leaning political ground.  Unfortunately, the stream of cheap attacks on the perceived European/leftist/academic intellectual complex drowns out much of the less biased and more genuinely insightful criticism found here.alist reportage (as opposed to their brand of writing) is the style and model for the new century.

H. Abrams as well as very recent ones, some written for this volume.  There is a little shrillness here and there, but by and large these are not so much 'culture war' attacks as they are substantive criticisms of very real issues, such as Derrida's actual knowledge of modern linguistics or the accuracy of his reading of Saussure.  Theory is notorious for its politicization of the academy and it is important to have thoughtful commentators such as Alan Sokal, Russell Jacoby, Todd Gitlin, and Noam Chomsky, whose opposition to aspects of Theory cannot be attributed to their political alignments.  Ad hominem smears are common weapons in the Theory arsenal and the editors have sought to immunize themselves against such attacks by including the works of individuals whose credentials, prior associations, and personal body of work cannot be attacked as easily as, e.g., a noticeably conservative, non-academic such as Roger Kimball.  The price we pay for this is the absence of pieces by such delicious combatants as Camille Paglia, but given the stakes we pay it.<br /><br />Since this is an anthology of dissent there is more emphasis on the sins and shortcomings of the dying tyrant than on constructive plans for the future, but there are some such plans here and they are interesting and suggestive.

Colonel Venable was lamenting that his plan didn't work.  In the many years since, I have tried to find that book again to document the footnote, to no avail.  But now I find that Tom Carhart has explained precisely Colonel Venable's discussion of the strategy Lee was using.  Especially impressive is his discussion of Napoleon's battles, which served as a model for Lee's actions on July 3, as well as during the other campaigns of the war.  In light of Carhart's explanations, Lee's lament, that if only he had had Jackson, is more easily understood.  It is unfortunate that Lee's shyness about written orders gave Longstreet so much latitude to deviate from the plan.  Even more disheartening from a Southern point of view was the defeat of Stuart's cavalry several miles east of Cemetery Ridge.  Again, his reason for being there is clearly explained by Dr. Carhart.  Clearly written in easily understandable prose, I would recommend this book to anyone, especially those who have wondered whether Lee was suddenly overtaken by mental problems that third day to have blundered so badly.  He wasn't--and didn't. <br /> <br />Theodore R. Lorah, Jr. <br />Adjunct Professor, Temple University	2005-08-31

"Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />What happened to Joe Mitchum?, wonders the whole town of Slapdown, TX when he goes overnight from being a ne'er-do-well to an upstanding citizen.<br /><br />Will Pendleton's life in nineteenth century Texas was going well, when a freak lightning strike took his life. He was a Texas Ranger, and darned proud of it, and he was just about to marry his lady love. Life was good... until his death. Ever since then, he has been waiting in limbo for a chance to have another lifetime with his soul mate. His chance finally comes when yet another freak lightning strike gives him the chance to take over Joe Mitchum's life and body.<br /><br />Dr. Mallory Peterson had dreamed her entire life of being a doctor. Even when the odds were stacked against her, she never gave up. After finishing her schooling, she returns to Slapdown as the local doctor, to thank them for all of their support over the years. Her life is her work, though she has never understood why she was so driven, or why deep down she feels an emptiness, one she never even noticed... until the day something extraordinary happens, changing everything.<br /><br />Joe was a slacker, drifting through his aimless life, driving Mallory crazy with his good-for-nothing ways. When he nearly dies after being struck by lightning, she saves his life, not having it in her nature to just let someone go without a fight. When he comes back from his near-death experience, he is a new man, and attempts to turn his life around. Mallory still doubts him, wondering when his slacker ways will start to reappear. What she doesn't know is that Joe is now Will, her soul mate, and that this may be the very last chance they get to be together. Now Joe and Mallory are in a race against time, and fate, for him to prove they belong together, before there are no chances left.<br /><br />Ms. Morris has written a delightful story here about soul mates and lost loves. Will is/was a morally strong man, intent on doing what was right and good, and happy in his chosen life. When all he had dreamed about was in his grasp, a cruel twist of fate snatches it away, leaving him bereft as he waits for one more chance. When he can't take the waiting anymore, he gets his chance and he grabs it with both hands. He is more than a little disturbed however, to see the mess Joe had made of his life, which now Will has to clean up.<br /><br />Mallory has spent her whole life to date on a quest for her dream, not letting anything stand in her way. Until the day that freak accident changed her life and made her realize that she was empty inside. Ms. Morris does a more than passable job of showing Mallory's growth as she comes to terms with her new feelings for Joe and what this change means to her. She goes through confusion, denial, and exploration while she tries to resolve her feelings.<br /><br />The idea of soul-mates through time and space is not a new one, but a slightly different spin is put on it in this tale. The premise of the \\"soul-switch\\" was unique, and makes the reader speculate on the \\"what ifs\\" of such an event. People will wonder, as reading the book, if reincarnation really is possible, and hopefully making them dream a little about what their past lives may have been, if anything at all. This reviewer certainly began to speculate about her own while reading this book; being a believer in past lives and soul mates.<br /><br />There is humor as well, in the form of Will's heavenly guardian, Celestian, and his bumbling through Will's (and Joe's) lives trying to make things right, but in the end making them oh-so-wrong more then once. One will chuckle more than once, upon finding out just how many mistakes were made along the way. There is also a hilarious twist at the end of this book, making the reader set the book down, upon completion, with a smile. One will be captivated by the story and this reviewer immediately went on a mission to find other books by Ms. Morrisas well.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, October 2003.

For any guy who doesn't want to live in Jeris' world... well, no, join the club.<br /><br />Unlike some other readers, I think this is SF; the science she's playing with is sociobiology. In Spencer's alternate history (????? most of this is my deductions), somewhere around the European discovery of the New World syphilis mutated to attack male infants, which is why so few men are born and sexual diseases  are so terrifying. I would guess that humanity was nearly wiped out. This is the more plausible because syphilis was a scourge in our history too.<br /><br />The socio- part of socio-biology describes how human culture adapts, and adapts to, human biology. The husband-buying, the male prostitution, are like the management of female fertility in our world. Spencer noticed that male fertility is, you might say, easier to share, and her families of sisters who work and marry together have a lot of biological paralells:  bees, lionesses. Culture, law, and economy follow sister-logic, which follows natural selection. It isn't rockets, but it's science.	2005-08-31

"Noel Coward's ironically entitled novella \\"Star Quality,\\" written in 1951, describes the production of a new play, with all its attendant problems.  Filled with sly observations drawn from Coward's own theatrical experience, \\"Star Quality\\" is so full of dramatic life that it is easy to see why Coward himself attempted to convert it to a play in 1956, and why other playwrights, such as Christopher Luscombe in this version, have used Coward's own script as a base, adding to it and ultimately producing it as a play.<br /><br />\\"Star Quality\\" begins its lively satire of the theatre when the respected Ray Malcolm is hired to be director, and the egomaniacal star Lorraine Barrie is chosen to be leading lady. The clash of egos and wills between Malcolm and Barrie is a foregone conclusion, though each insists, almost as a refrain, that \\"the play comes first.\\"  Barrie, the \\"star,\\" insists that they hire the less-than-qualified Marian Blake as a supporting character, primarily because she knows that Blake will not (and cannot) compete with her for the limelight.  She then decides that the entire ending must be rewritten to give her a more dramatic final scene. When Malcolm decides to fire the newly hired Blake for incompetence and hire a new actor, Barrie starts using her trump cards, and the fate of the production hangs in the balance.<br /><br />The plot, with its fairly predictable twists, pokes fun at the all-too-common machinations of various theatrical characters driven by inflated egos.  The characters themselves are exaggerated stereotypes which the audience will recognize as humorous stock characters.  Of particular note, however, is the character of Tony, a friend of the director. Writing long before gay liberation, Coward is completely open here about the role of gays in the theatre and their influence on productions, though he skirted around this subject in his play Present Laughter.  Casting a jaundiced eye on his own profession, Coward uses his wit and mordant humor to remove the mystery and romance from play production at the same time that he reveals his own love and excitement for the action. n Mary Whippleant humor to remove the mystery and romance from play production at the same time that he reveals his own love and excitement for the action. n Mary Whipple <br />"	2005-08-31

Her life is full enough as she begins a new job, anticipates a move into her own apartment, and makes outrageous plans to regain the attention of her former boyfriend. Her mother's most recent drama is not a welcome intrusion into Savannah's life of chaos.<br /><br />But try as she might, Savannah just can't ignore the towns main attraction - her mother.

This book was a great read if you are interested in learning about why young immigrants of color differ from their parents and their host society, wherever it is. I should know, because I am one! I am also a sociology student who is interested in ethnographic research. Regarding the book, I enjoyed the fact that the author used interviews and direct quotes when highlighting various issues, and that these quotes served as a major reflection of this book's methodology, argument and findings (rather than having to rely on, and/or siphon through a bunch of theoretical assumptions and arguments, as is sometimes the case in ethnographic studies of this nature.) I also liked the fact that the author pretty much got straight to the point when he broke down the point of the research, without having weed through too much \\"fluff\\" in the book, aside from a little background information, which is vital to understand how and why Haitians are in Canada in the first place. In this senese, I was able to understand the research in the book without getting lost in the mundane details of it. While this book is not of a particulary extensive length, I believe that it is a good introduction to the subject of Haitian youth in Canada, and it says what needs to be said in order to gain a beginning understanding of some of the parameters that minorities (especially minority youth) face and are confronted with on a daily basis in North America. Without question there is much more that needs to be researched concerning immigrant/minority youth (including Haitians); both in Canada and the United States. Let's face it, minority youth are always forgotten about, and it is a real travesty considering that we are usually quite different from both our parents and the majority culture, despite the fact that both of these groups often wish that we would not be distinctive of them.Haiti and Haitians are fascinating subjects for anyone interested in ethnic studies, and one can only hope that more books will be devoted to these topics in the future. If you want to learn a little more about young Haitians, this book is for you. I am happy to see a book devoted solely to Haitian youth in Qubec, and I can only hope that the author will continue to research this topic in greater detail in other areas of North America where there are many Haitians living (like in NYC or Florida). A comparative study looking at Haitain youth in the USA and Canada would be very interesting, as they too have issues that distinguish them from their parents and everyone else."	2005-08-31

There are several occupational hazards of being an economist, the most irksome being that you have to pretend that politics and economics are not only different but actually separate.  This sort of thinking is fine when one is engaged in a certain type of scientific economics - the dispassionate explanation of an aspect of our economic arrangements - but is a disaster when it comes to explaining real life economies.  Market societies, for better and worse, are the product of deeply rooted economic imperatives that play out against institutions built in political - power - struggles between people with opposing interests and disparate means to achieve their ends.  Economies are jerry-rigged, improvised institutions that sometimes work well and sometimes work very, very badly.  Because Lynn is not an economist, he is less inclined to worship at the altar of free markets and more inclined to look at how the self-interested actions of leading business men and women, government officials and the general public combine to create risk as well as opportunity in our global economic commons. Lynn's lack of free market piety will earn him critics among the acolytes of laissez faire economics, but the rest of us should be grateful that he writes about the real world in these confusing times.   <br /> <br />Lynn's point in End of the Line is to remind us that the global economy is, like all human creations, a grand improvisation that creates and distributes wealth in ways that are beyond the control of its designers in business and government.  Lynn has penned a wise, witty and at times angry look at globalization that departs from the stale argument about whether global capitalism is good or bad in favor of a far more subtle, and scary portrait of a risk laden production system that is, at least for now, beyond any government's control.  End of the Line is a meditation on what happens when short term self-interest leads global businesses to make bottom line decisions that enhance their own profitability in ways that increase the vulnerability of the system as a whole, and governments abdicate their responsibility to monitor and manage an economy - even a global economy - for the sake of the common good. <br /> <br />Lynn asks us to see the global economy as a vast and intricate system of economic plumbing that links suppliers and customers in every corner of the globe.  This plumbing system is nothing but an ever evolving set of connections that becomes denser when corporations outsource their operations to producers in lower cost countries in order to provide customers with high quality products at low prices.  The global growth of free trade, with relatively little regulation or oversight by governments in the interest of global prosperity, has been an immense boon to the fortunes of millions of previously desperately people around the world, whose incomes and life chances have blossomed because they are making goods and services that people in rich countries want and need.   <br /> <br />Yet, common sense tells us that an unregulated plumbing system, left to grow by itself without any supervision or rules, is bound to develop all sorts of problems that mushroom into total system failure under the wrong circumstances.  Imagine the eventual public health disaster that would happen in a city that let all building and homeowners make their own connections to the main water and sewer lines.  The resulting mess would poison our water and cities with filth because no agent was responsible for managing the system in the interest of the community as a whole.  A smooth flow of water and sewage requires regulation of the rational plumbing system in order for everyone to prosper from the use of water and the proper management of waste. <br /> <br />End of the Line makes an urgent yet curiously under-appreciated point: The contemporary global economy is a very leaky plumbing system that is subject to catastrophic breakdown because its evolution is driven by the private interests of global corporate managers rather than the common good.  This leaky plumbing system is the result of a deliberate choice by the global government - the United States - to refrain from managing the world economy in our nation's interests in favor of a utopian vision of a planet wide free market that would regulate itself, and thereby eventually enrich the world.  Lynn has bad news for all who believe that the free market is all the world needs to have peace, security and stability: the breakdown of the global economy's plumbing will lead to the same kind of mess as an unregulated system of city plumbing unless we are smart enough to realize that a free market requires a strong, smart and wise government to deftly manage the world economy with a light but competent touch.   <br /> <br />End of the Line is not an anti-globalization screed about how global capitalism is destroying the world's poorest people, or poisoning our environment, or generating corruption on an epic scale.  Instead, Lynn wants to alert us to the fact that we have created a global economy where a natural disaster or political conflict could disrupt the entire system in ways that threaten the well-being, or in extreme cases, the lives of millions of people.  The culprit here is the old conflict between the private and the public interest, this time played out on a global scale.  Lynn wants us to see how our love affair with the free market has, inadvertently but predictably, created economic insecurity that can only be handled by government or governments.   <br /> <br />The lesson that Lynn drives home is clear and difficult to avoid: either the leading power in the global economy - the United States - will step up to the task of managing capitalism in its own interest in light of its sense of the legitimate interests of the rest of the world or someother power will take over global leadership.  If, no when, the global system's plumbing breaks down in the future, some nations or group of nations will fix the resulting mess, and promulgate rules and regulations to reduce the likelihood of system failure in the future.  The US cannot afford to wait so long that some other power or powers, with the approval of the rest of the world, offer a credible alternative vision for managing the global economic system in light of their own interests as well as their understanding of our interests.  Such a circumstance is a sure road to conflict - hot or cold, or both. <br /> <br />End of the Line is also an announcement of a new type of American economic nationalism, where Lynn makes a case for a strong American role in the management of the global economy in the interest of the American people.  According to Lynn, the threats to global economic security and American prosperity are the result of the deliberate policies of the Clinton administration, which foolishly downgraded the role of the US government in building and managing global trade in favor of free market ideologies that ignore the historical fact that markets function best when governments intervene with the right mix of wisdom and restraint.  The Clinton administration portrayed in End of the Line looks less like the interventionist, big government liberals bent on supplanting free markets with government power in the interest of some idea of justice or the social good and more like a successor to the Reagan/Bush the Elder administrations' project of restraining and rolling back the New Deal in favor of the revival of capitalism \\"red in tooth and claw\\".  Sections of End of the Line suggest that Clinton and his associates are better seen as the second of three successive Bush administrations - with Clinton et al as the not-well-loved but useful adopted children of the Elder Bush and disdained siblings of Bush the Younger - bent on rationalizing and consolidatingthe Reagan revolution against a strong US government in economic affairs.  This indictment, which will outrage as many Democrats as Republicans, is essentially right: Clinton was the kinder, gentler Bush whose paternalistic worries about the common man and woman never deflected him from the path of opening the US economy to the gales of creative destruction and globalization which drive growing income disparities at home and, according to Lynn, increasing economic insecurity in the global economy overall.  Lynn treats Clinton and the Democrats of his era as people who try to soften the blow that the global march toward capitalism must deliver to weak Americans rather than a force trying to create a new social contract that spread the fruits of wealthy widely while preparing us all to live a very competitive economic world.   <br /> <br />This book is, among other things, a powerful salvo in the war between Democrats over the future of the party, and therefore the nature of progressive politics in this country.  Let the fight over the future of the Democratic Party - or more likely, its successor - begin in earnest. <br />"	2005-08-31

An expedtion is then sent to follow his trail. One of the expedition's members is the son of the leader of that lost expedition which adds a personal theme. Rollins does not overwhelm the reader with this character's emotional baggage but gives us just enough information always at the right time to makes us hope he does what out what happened to his father. <br /> <br />There is a love interest that also never bogs down the plot which is loaded with perhaps the most action in any Rollins' novel. In fact I thought the action exceeded that of his first novel \\"Subterranean\\". Rollins' brings the reader right into the heart of the Amazon where you'll battle 100ft. caimans, mutant poisonous amphibians, carnivorous locusts, giant jaguars, ruthless mercenaries and a headhunting sadistic witch doctor.  <br /> <br />Rollins' respect for the military is also evident as the Army Rangers characters are not stereotypical robotic G.I. Joes but rather brave, resourceful, honor-bound individuals that he does develop to a point of becoming a part of the plot. <br /> <br />Rollins writes this novel so well that when the action does slow down you start wondering what lies around the next river bend and...Rollins does not disappoint us. <br /> <br />Amazonia is a mix of action, superb character development, geography, military tactics, amazonian mysticism unbreakable family bonds and a healthy respect for nature's power all wrapped into one steamy, fast-paced jungle adventure. <br /> <br />Amazonia...is a must read. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />"	2005-08-31

"This is by far one of the most fun I have ever had reading a book in a long time!!! The storyline is wonderful and enchanting, keeping you entertained through the entire book. The story revolves around Alessi Moore, a 21-year-old woman who believes in halos and angels and is basically an orphan, having no family that wants her. She arrives in Charity, after seeing a halo around the town, only to have her car stolen with all her worldly possesions in it right from under her. She is befriended by Ben and Dave, two convenient store owners, who give her a room for the night and friendship that will last a lifetime. Arriving on the scene Steve, a guy who instantly gives Alessi a cold shoulder and tells her that her car will never be found. As the story progresses, Steve realizes he has fallen in love with Alessi and everything that she believes in. The suspense surrounding this story is the town has made a \\"pact\\" that no one will speak of. Alessi becomes the victim of cruel jokes, and the belief that no one in Charity wants to help her, except maybe Ben and Dave. That's all I'm going to say as far as the storyline goes, but I will go on to say that if you want a story that will entertain, keep you in suspense, and make you believe in angels, than this is the book for you!"	2005-08-31

Presently the leader of his coven, he holds the future of many witches, and humans, in his grasp.  However, another witch wants the power Drake has and will do anything to get it. The only way to minimize the threat to his rule is for Drake to find his complement... the female witch who is his match in all things, who --- once they have combined forces, will make them near invincible.<br /><br />Rhea Brown has never known the legacy her grandmother left her, until she unlocks the secrets held by her parents for many years. Now she has come into her destiny, but as yet is a novice to the world of magick. Never did she see coming, the one man who would be her strength... or her undoing. Fate has a way of taking things into its own hands, as Rhea finds out when she meets her soul mate.<br /><br />Rhea and Drake's relationship begins on another plane of reality and is absolutely incredible. When they meet in person, it is just as incredible. But the evil witch conspiring to take over the coven is after Rhea as he wants her for his own... and the legendary power it will wield for him. Will Drake and Rhea overcome the evil to be together as they are fated to be?  This was a wonderful story of love and passion. Having read other works by this author under another pen name, it was expected that this book would be well written also. It did not disappoint. Ms. Morgan has a talent for weaving worlds that entrance and captivate... her own brand of magick perhaps? One will enjoy the images invoked through reading this book, wanting to believe that the magick is indeed all around, if only knowing where to look.<br /><br />Drake and Rhea are strong characters, made even stronger by their mutual attraction and love. He is a true alpha male, powerful, uncompromising, and completely wrapped up in the spell Rhea holds over him --- of a different kind of magick entirely. She is a delight as well, at first a little disbelieving of her previously unknown abilities, but who wouldn't be? However, she quickly learns how to use her magick, surprising everyone with her unmatched talent. There are several secondary characters as well that delight, making one hope more stories in the series will follow.<br /><br />As for the love scenes? Hot, hot, hot, and even hotter! Passion ignites, be it in reality or on the astral plane. The descriptions are vibrant, bringing the reader into the scenes quite completely.

US	35481878	R121TEIJQG73Z1	0743453441	385709050	The War in Heaven (Eternal Warriors)	Books	3	14	15	False	True	A decent first effort marred by too much  annoyingly bad dialogue	"For someone who favors the very dry (and very English) style of fantasy writers like Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, Theodore Beale's \\" The War In Heaven\\" proved to be a surprisingly enjoyable departure.<br /><br />Like Gaiman and Pratchett, Beale fills his book with angelic beings facing a crisis. But these are not the comedic \\"Good Omens\\" angels who accidentally misplace the Antichrist at the start of a tongue-in-cheek battle of good and evil.<br /><br />No, Beale's angels aren't bungling slouches. They're warriors, Biblically-based figures embellished with the author's imagination. They have to be. The book opens with a war brewing - a war in which the forces of evil plan to storm the gates of heaven.<br /><br />Of course, every war needs an Ultimate Weapon, and for the Legions of Satan that weapon is a disenfranchised 16-year-old geek named Christopher with an inferiority complex and a serious gaming habit. Christopher also has two younger, twin sisters - Holli and Jami. And although the trio is watched over by guardian angels, the protection isn't enough to keep Christopher from being lured away by a smooth-talking fallen angel named Kaym, who assumes the human form of a Rayban wearing biker type with dragon tattoos.<br /><br />Kaym plays to Christopher's pride and desire to fit in to get him on the team. It's a task made all the easier with a trip to meet Lucifer himself, who seals the deal through a mixture of charm, false promises and beauty. Physical appearance is a big part of the book, and Beale does a masterful job of placing a subtle emphasis on the duality of beauty. In the case of the good angels, it shines from within, emanating outward and enhancing already good looks or compensating for average ones. For Satan and the bad angels, beauty is a mask that can only temporarily hide the ugliness and evil that eventually comes through in dramatic fashion.<br /><br />The battle scenes are another of the books strong points. Beale's gaming background proves to be a real asset as he describes the war strategies that lead to dramatically detailed victories and defeats for both sides. It helps that some of the creatures who take part in the action - from the winged lions to the dragon-like Leviathan - are so well-described. The cast of characters on both sides were also rich and diverse, from the Galadriel-like Lady of the Tower to a very moving and uniquely portrayal of Jesus.<br /><br />But the book isn't without its faults. It's a wonder, for instance, how Beale expects the reader to believe that the legions of darkness could it their own shoes - let alone consider themselves warriors - if they have to rely on a 16-year-old mortal's Warhammer experience to help them mount a successful offense.<br /><br />The book's weakest point is its dialogue, which was - in spots -  painful to read. The book wastes a lot of time in chit-chat between characters that is neither particularly interesting nor even relevant to the story. The weakest dialogue, however, is reserved for Holli and Jami.  With overuse of the word \\"like,\\" the author came across as trying too hard to make the girls sound natural, with the opposite result. Instead, it comes across as annoying, a problem exacerbated by  the disappointing insertion of petty and unbelievable sniping at times when the girls are fighting for their survival. Perhaps this was Beale's attempt to inject some comic relief into these situations; if it was, he fell short in the attempt. Rather than being funny, the exchanges came across as completely inappropriate. Also, by forcing Jamie and Holli into such a stereotypical ditzy-girl roles, Beale fails to make them as believable as they could have been, which is frustrating since unbelievable characters and dialogue sap strength from a good plot faster than anything else.<br /><br />The book wasn't at all subtle with its Christian message, which some may perceive as preachy. This is no surprise given that Beale's alter ego, Vox Day, is a marginalized right wing nut and former contributor to the bizarre, fringe \\"news site\\" WorldNetDaily.<br /><br />Even so, the book wasn't a terrible first showing. And while it wasn't entirely my cup of tea, I've read worse. Not much worse, but worse.arginalized right wing nut and former contributor to the bizarre, fringe \\"news site\\" WorldNetDaily.<br /><br />Even so, the book wasn't a terrible first showing.

When I started, I had questions and doubts that pastors had answered with:  \\"You just need more faith\\".  At MH, I can ask questions, as well as dig into the Word.  I have been encouraged to take seminary classes, get into a solid study fellowship, and to remember that it is ok to wrestle with God.  Since then, my faith has increased greatly and for the first time in my life, I have assurance that I am saved. <br /> <br />Also, now that I don't feel as encumbered by these doubts, I have been better able to live life more closely to the way Jesus intended. <br /> <br />The reason I am stating all this is because Velvet Elvis is basically a bunch of Rob's sermons.  I've heard them all before.  Maybe the reason the MH folks have been so positive is that we have heard all of the ideas in Velvet Elvis in strong detail in numerous, numerous sermons.  Rob explains the research behind the sermons.  Also, we have had the opportunity to challenge things that Rob says on a weekly basis.  Every time I have questioned Rob, I have felt treated respectfully and been encouraged to keep studying the Word. <br /> <br />The only negative I have about the book is that Rob isn't able to convey as much in a short book as he did in the sermons. <br /> <br />Also, MH wasn't a Calvary Church plant.  I attended Calvary for 20 years.  They just asked how many people they could estimate leaving to go to MH.  I don't know much about church-planting, but it seems to me that there could be multiple Mars Hill churches.  I know there is a journal called Mars Hill Review and there is a Mars Hill seminary, but I don't think they have anything to do with MH in Michigan. <br /> <br />You can rip on the book all you want.

The first volume of a projected two-volume set (the second to cover the more recent decades), it is thorough, balanced, rich in information and highly readable. The wealth of historic data provides a sense of actuality and immediacy to what remains, after more than half a century, a fantastic and improbable tale. <br />Dolan's focus is the modern technological age, his approach that of the chronicler. His concern is with the documented facts of his subject, and these facts are marshalled in a manner that there remains little need for advocacy or polemic. As such his work, incendiary though the content may be, presents as essentially neutral - the kind of thing that could sit next on the shelf to any other authoritative history and may be palatable even to UFO sceptics. What essentially emerges is that a profound mystery has engaged the classified world of intelligence and defense these last fifty years and, what is closely related, that a bizarre disparity exists between official culture and the said secretive cabals. <br />Dolan is moreover aware that more than a scientific mystery is at stake. The way humanity responds to this mystery - whether in open, honest enquiry or a fear-driven, secretive and controlling agenda - is likely to be of defining moment for the human future. <br />HK.	2005-08-31

What is relevant is the Islam that is in actual practice today--the beliefs and politics of Muslims worldwide in 2005. <br /> <br />     Polls show that more than 90% of the populations of Palestine and Pakistan believe the 9/11 attacks were justified by the United States' policies toward the Muslim world in general and Palestine and Israel in particular. The percentages are almost as high in most other heavily Muslim countries. These are hardly the beliefs of a peaceful and tolerate religion. <br /> <br />     However noble its roots (which is subject to question), Islam today bears little resemblance to the Islam of centuries ago, having been hijacked and perverted on a world-wide scale by the Saudi-backed Wahabbism and the brainwashing of children, and creation of psychotic assassins, in the madrassas--the so-called \\"religious schools\\"--started and funded in many Muslim countries by the Saudis. <br /> <br />     What kind of religion can create hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of cold-blooded psychotic killers? Not one of peace and tolerance. <br /> <br />     People like this author Winter love to dismiss the Muslim terrorists and their millions of supporters and apologists as an alleged \\"extremist\\" or fringe group. They are indeed extremist, but they most assuredly are not a fringe group. To the contrary, they represent the vast majority of Muslims worldwide today. Sadly, the peaceful and tolerant Muslims--and there are many--are a small and decreasing minority."	2005-08-31

(spoilers)	"The basic concept is \\"generic orcs working for generic dark powers raid a dimension-travelling dragon's cave and find a horde of 21st century weapons.\\" That could have been played marvellously. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the execution is botched. Horribly. <br /> <br />For starters, when they take the weapons, the orcs are all affected by the \\"Dragon's Curse\\" that makes them assume the personality of US Marines. Reading through about 500 pages of practically nothing but stereotypical marine talk and attitudes, with only slight hints of orcishness, is not my idea of a good read, or at least not for a fantasy novel (if this was, say, Tom Clancy I wouldn't complain). This almost seems like the author wanted to write a military novel but couldn't sell it, so she slapped on a few fantasy elements to help the sale. <br /> <br />Not only do they HAVE 21st century weapons, but they soon start MAKING 21st century weapons. With Tolkien-esque technology, and they are specifically mentioned as being non-magical. Umm... <br /> <br />The orcs are survivors of the Last Battle of Light and Dark, on the side of Dark obviously, but have no problem selling their new super-weapons to the victorious members of the armies of the Light. Nor do the armies of the Light have any problem BUYING these new weapons of megadeath from the forces of the Dark. <br /> <br />Speaking of Light, the \\"good guys\\" aren't particularly good. I'm not talking about one or two minor flaws, or even anti-heroes. I'm talking about the forces of Light not really having a problem with the orcs eating living men, elves, dwarves and halflings during their sales meetings. Mind you, the forces of Light consist OF men, elves, dwarves, and halflings. <br /> <br />On the topic of halflings, they're definitely the most grating characters in the book. The lead orc falls in love with one, with no lead-in, after two pages and marries her in twenty (this does not stop him from continuing to eat other halflings alive). This halfling, by the way, is a duchess but whenever she gets bored she runs an S&M whorehouse. Her sons, meanwhile, are two sociopathic murderers-thieves-conmen who gleefully slaughter whole families to make just a few coins. We're supposed to root for them, by the way. <br /> <br />If the forces of petty evil are annoying, the forces of Grand Evil (symbolized in the orcs' master, the nameless necromancer, and HIS master, the Dark Lord) are the really interesting characters in the book. So of course we don't see much of them. <br /> <br />Oh, and in the third part of the book, the entire world is invaded by intelligent, weapon-using versions of the xenomorphs from Aliens. I am not making this up."	2005-08-31

The Crimean War, together with serfdom, is quite an embarrassment for the Russians and George MacDonald Fraser spares none of his literary talents describing the 'beauty' and 'excitement' of Russian life in the middle of 19 century. Well, Flashman definitely enjoys certain aspects of it (you can easily imagine which ones). What catapults him into the Land of Tsars was, first of all, the Crimean War (which he skillfully tried to avoid but as usual getting himself into the pickle) and, as it happened, an unfortunate Charge of the Light Brigade, where he earns hard a status of a POW through his yet again outstanding cowardice. His life on the estate in a beautifully described southern rural Russia (or Ukraine to be precise) turns into yet another amorous affair with a beautiful daughter of a Cossack noble (with another surprise there too, mind you). Such fabulous captivity is abruptly interrupted by this foul Russian institution -serfdom- which catapults him into another adventure now in Central Asia (which was fighting not to be Russian at that time) where Flashy meets East again with more shocks and surprises for a reader (and Flashman). Prepare yourself for a Russian steambath, eavesdrop on the enemy's secrets after a passionate date and think how to make your sled lighter when you are on the run with a beauty because the chase is on and Cossacks are on the way!	2005-08-31

"Kathryn Harrison's latest novel, \\"Envy,\\" opens with protagonist Will Moreland, a New York City psychoanalytic psychotherapist, about to attend his 25th college reunion. His wife Carole is adamant about not accompanying him, although he tries to tempt her with descriptions of the luxury hotel where he will be staying, the pool, excellent restaurants, room service, and pay-per-view. The fact is, Carole cannot cope with the inevitable questions that will be asked by strangers. Until three years ago the Morelands were a family of four. There were two children then, Samantha and Luke. Ten year-old Luke died in a tragic boating accident and both parents are still dealing with their grief. Then there will be the comments and curiosity about Will's identical twin, another Cornell alumni, the famous Mitchell Moreland. Mitch, a world renown long-distance swimmer, is as well known a sports figure as Lance Armstrong or Tiger Woods. Unfortunately the athlete has been estranged from his family since Will's wedding. He left the reception shortly after delivering the traditional best man's toast to the bride and groom, and has not made contact with his relatives since - over ten years now. Although Will is not thrilled about discussing these private aspects of his life, his inquisitiveness about his fellow alumni of the class of '79 overcomes his reluctance to attend. He also wants to obtain some information from an old lover about something he had read in the recent alumni bios - something which is causing him great anxiety.<br /><br />At the party Will strikes up a slightly flirtatious conversation with Elizabeth, the ex-girlfriend whom he has not seen in twenty-five years. He discovered that she has a daughter, now in her mid-twenties, and after doing the math realizes the baby was born a few months after the two broke up. Although Elizabeth married late in her pregnancy, Moreland cannot help but wonder if he is the father. Their encounter turns hostile when he requests a DNA sample - a strand of the daughter's hair to determine paternity. He leaves the festivities a day early and when he returns home does not mention the incident his wife.<br /><br />Carol Moreland, a calm, serene woman, had always been open to discussing anything with Will. Her husband thinks of her as a woman who \\"seems at peace with life, with herself. Not like me.\\" Since the death of their son, however, she has distanced from her husband both physically and emotionally. She used to be a passionate sexual partner, up for anything - not any more. Oddly, though Carole practices yoga and meditation, she is addicted to violent true crime books - so graphic that she hides them from her young daughter. She really does not want to discuss their problems, although Will, as a shrink who is his own favorite patient, longs to talk about and analyze their lack of communication, among other subjects. Actually, Will is something of a motor mouth, always ready to go on at length about his feelings, problems, dreams, the unconscious, etc.. He is really too analytical and over-intellectualizes his own difficulties. Moreland winds up going back into therapy with his training analyst, Daniel, a psychiatrist's psychiatrist who has worked with him before.<br /><br />Moreland also talks frankly with his aging father, a retired veterinarian, who at seventy has become an artistic photographer - even exhibiting his work in a SoHo gallery. He is having an affair with a younger woman, with his wife's consent.<br /><br />The primary reason Will goes back into analysis, is because he has begun to have violent and vivid sexual fantasies about every women he sees, including his patients, which makes it extremely difficult for him to function effectively in his therapeutic role. He is depressed. He also obsesses about his past relationship with his twin, who was born with a port-wine stain that colored more than half his face purple. The boy was teased mercilessly by other children. As a result, he became shy and self-conscious at an early age. He actually took up long distance swimming because it is a loner's sport. Will has always felt guilty at having been born \\"unmarked.\\"  The man is stressed out to the extent that he has considered taking a leave of absence from his practice. I find Will to be a very sympathetic character and the source of much of the novel's humor, as well as its sadness. His conversations with his analyst and patients are also very interesting and provide tremendous insight into basic psychoanalytic techniques - except for one potential analysand.<br /><br />An outrageous young woman, (highly inappropriate behavior), comes to Will's office for an intake. She is essential to the plot, but her interactions with Will are (hopefully) purely fictionalized. The girl, in her early twenties, is sexually obsessed with older men. In fact, she \\"collects\\" them. She describes her sexual adventures to Will explicitly, blow-by-blow accounts, obviously looking to excite him and add him to her collection. Her \\"Fatal Attraction\\" behavior provides an element of the suspense thriller at times.<br /><br />Kathryn Harrison has done it again. This is a beautifully written, intelligent novel, whose characters, and their inner workings, are more exciting than what goes on in the world around them. Their development and dialogue are brilliant, as are the author's descriptions of the surroundings, the  city and countryside, even the poignant photographs taken by Will's dad. There are also some major surprises which will shock - at least they shocked me - in terms of various betrayals. \\"Envy\\" is certainly an appropriate title for this book.<br /><br />Much of the author's writing contains themes of narcissism, family violation, physical suffering and sexual taboo. \\"Envy\\" is more humorous than her other books that I have read, and more erotic. Although there are painful moments, and the subject of possible incest does come up, pain and suffering are not the main focus. \\"Envy\\"  definitely deserves 5 Stars, as far as I am concerned, and I highly recommend it.

First, the eccentric characters were not unlike those that one runs into routinely in a venue I'm more familiar with--small town deep south. Though flavored of California, of wine country, and of blue-state sensibilities, dress any one of the Sonomans in a blue sports coat and khakis and stick a bourbon-and-coke in his hand and you have yourself an everyday southerner of some stripe. Rich, poor, pretentious, humble, genuine, phony, romantic, hateful, kind, any of these just so long as slightly eccentric-cum-affected.  Secondly, I noted a similarity in the characters' efforts to find transcendent meaning by pursuing pastimes with literal religious fervor. Wine, wine making, environmentalism, green space preservation, leisure--all find their place as the god of some Sonoman who otherwise found deity deceased in college and liked it that way, or so he thought. In parallel, take a less than rare southerner and find him worshiping on the gridiron any given Saturday or gleaning metaphysical truth from a blues man in a juke joint and you'll see the reverse image of your friendly Sonoman.  I thought the book was well written and, intentionally or no, painted a clear picture of postmodern man's failure to find meaning. No idol satisfies, no passion fulfills, and A Tale of Two Valleys depicts that nicely.	2005-08-31

Use a standard tin can (the size that Campbell's chicken noodle soup or diced tomatoes, veggies, etc. come in) and cut out the biscuits.  Then they are brushed with melted butter and go into probably a 350 deg oven until done.

You can match this against traditional southern biscuits and probably get a better idea of ingredients and quantity.    I need a southern fried chicken receipe for my new Lodge cast iron 3 qt lidded chicken fryer.

How much is enough when it comes to stunts and mean-spirited practical jokes? Where does the power of an organization lie, and why? What constitutes the balance between friendship, loyalty, and betrayal? <br /> <br />While I like the idea behind a grim and gritty look at the secret life of high school students, I can't say I enjoyed the execution at all. The book takes itself too seriously, as do the characters involved. The heavy tone would be more understandable if it was presented in the spirit of realism, but the proceedings never have that touch of believability that is needed to make fiction compelling. It comes off as a second-rate soap opera presented to the tastes of an adolescent male audience.  <br /> <br />We live in a world where many high schools have gangs, and those gangs maintain their status by perpetrating violence against those who cross some threshold of behavior. But in this world, there is a gang that rarely if ever resorts to violence, and yet which is so feared and respected that not a single student in the school will deny their fear of them. Even students from other schools know about the terrible Vigils. This is just too unbelievable a setup to be presented in such a serious manner.  <br /> <br />The interactions between the characters are rarely believable, mostly because of the extreme (and extremely simple) reactions that the characters experience. For example, Carter, a strong, athletic individual, decides to tip off the administration about an impending prank. When Archie, the cold-blooded leader of the Vigils, suspects Carter, he begins making a series of harassing phone calls. Carter finds this to be so terrifyingly traumatic that he becomes a twisting bundle of agonized nerves, and his fear ruins his life.  <br /> <br />Another problem I had is that there were just too many competing storylines, some of which failed to reach a satisfactory conclusion.  <br /> <br />I came into this book cold, and that might have been part of my problem. The Chocolate War might have established this world and these characters in such a way that the book's weaknesses could be overlooked.

"The Civil War was not politically a 'bipartisan' war in anything like the sense what would be true of the two world wars.  It was required to be waged as a party war.  The Republicans became Union to throw people off.  Theoretically, it was a Republican victory.  It is legend that the ruthless quality of Southern reconstruction was the outgrowth of hatreds carried over from wartime and prolonged.  The Northerners did not know how to manage their 'great victory' over the South; thus, it was a disastrophe -- to say the least.  There was a conspiracy to take over and turn the white Southerners into slaves!  Slaves of conscience, slaves to sin, not to Christ.<br /><br />Andrew Johnson was not exactly a Tennessean but we claim his as one of our own.  The Andrew Johnson Hotel on the River here was the tallest building and certainly glamorous (still is inside); that is the place where Hank Williams, Sr., died when his chauffeur stopped there to let him 'dry out.'  Johnson had an impossible duty to the country to fulfill and he performed badly.  Like the other Johnson president some hundred years later, who ascended to the presidency the same way he did ([...] of the real president, Lincoln, Kennedy) also from the South, they chose the wrong programs to push through the public: civil rights.  Both ended disastrously.<br /><br />This 17th president, now two and a half centuries since his time, has his reputation rehabilitated a bit.  He changed parties and, thus, the Democratic nation was founded.  Read STORY OF THE COPPERHEADS, THE HIDDEN CIVIL WAR by Gray Wood.<br /><br />Johnson was almost impeached, but that's nothing special; if you're from the South, the Northerners automatically try to bring the important person down to their size.  Why is it that so many of them moved South?  We are inundated with those harsh-speaking 'know-it-all's who want to change us.  If we are so bad in the South, I can't understand why they came here in the first place.  Another Southern president, Clinton, was almost impeached.  Richard Nixon, from California, was almost impeached.  Blount was, too, when he was Tennessee's Governor.  But impeachment never happens.  I can't see why they go to all of that bother to desecrate the reputation as, if they are worthy to be elected president, they will overcome the bad name and rebound, like Jefferson Davis did for the Confederacy.<br /><br />Just saw white-haired Ms. Pelot in a replay of the Beer Board on city Council still wearing that yellow, sexy, low-cut top with her white beads.  She is trying to be a Southern belle but won't make it.  They even bought a special chair for her.  She was elected four years ago, and now it is her time to go as she has clearly taken over the reigns of Mayorship.

"When Morris \\"Mookie\\" Lovett wins a rap contest, he leaves his familiar life in Orlando, Florida and goes to ritzy Los Angeles, California.  With his superb hip-hop skills, good looks, and charisma, he feels he is destined for stardom.  His girlfriend Pam and best friend Fatimus follow him to Los Angeles with dreams of their own success.  Once the trio arrives in L.A. they experience the effect of Mookie's fame, fans, fortune, and unfortunately, females.  The  conclusion of this book lets us see how Mookie deals with success, how Pam deals with Mookie's infidelity, and how Fatimus learns how to look out for himself.<br /><br />The story was so realistic that I would not be surprised if it were true.  There are several major conflicts that are dealt with very maturely in this book:  the depth of friendships, the relationship between a father and his son, the difference between platonic love and amorous love, how a young man deals with quick fame and fortune, and how deadly and addictive illegal drugs can be and their effect on your life choices.  The most popular theme is \\"what is done in the dark will eventually come to light.\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed Michael T. Owens' writing style and felt he did a wonderful job with A DREAM COME TRUE.  It was a well-paced story with a great, unpredictable ending.  The characters were interesting, the plot lines were managed very well, and the book had just enough drama to get the reader emotionally involved in the storyline.

Author Jim Fisher does an excellent job of bringing the reader along with him as he essentially stumbles into the 30-year-old Zubryd murder case and becomes entangled in a web of inconsistencies surrounding the evidence, the crime scene, and the boy's confession, and eventually uncovers the identity of the true murderer. He describes the investigative process matter-of-factly, never lapsing into tediousness or overplaying the drama. Fisher lays out his reasoning beautifully, and the reader experiences every nagging question, every false hope, and every thrilling break in the case right alongside the detectives. How Fisher then became involved in the Stevick/Pacek case, which ultimately helped spur the Zubryd investigation, makes this already amazing story truly stunning.  <br /> <br />A great true-life thriller made all the more haunting because of its myriad victims: the murder victims, the wrongfully accused, their families, and the actual or potential subsequent victims of the true perpetrators. The senselessness of the frame-ups, in both cases, boggle the mind. Thought-provoking, fascinating, and chilling. I can't praise this work enough, and God bless Jim Fisher for bringing the truth to light in these tragic cases.	2005-08-31

At any rate, regarding Southern Fried Divorce, I have read it 3 or 4 times already.  There is so much humor here but also so much bittersweet truth.

This book is not an overview of the whole conflict but deals with the decisive battle of the war, the Spartan Brigade's armored thrusts into the heart of Baghdad from April 6-8.  The three days of combat are described in awesome detail and in the brutal fighting that took place, scores of Iraqi fighters attacked relentlessly and without any coordiation.   <br /> <br />The fighting showed just how undisciplined and unorganized the enemy was in comparison to the most professional army in the world.  Hundreds of them were gunned down and dozens of their vehicles(pick up trucks, cars, buses, taxis) were destroyed in their suicide charges.  Nevertheless, the Spartan Brigade took casualties with men being killed or wounded and Mr. Zucchino did an excellent job describing how the soldiers dealth with it.   <br /> <br />Another huge plus for this book is the lack of anything political.  Other accounts by embedded journalists that are coming out usually have the author's opinions about the war slipped in somewhere, whether they be right or left.  Here is simply a great read about the soldiers of the Spartan Brigade in action and will probably down as one of the greatest books on Modern Combat in the 21st Century.

His adopted daughter Haley Walthers worked with him, but was fired from Sanker after being accused of stealing other scientist's work.  Sanker Corp is located in the beautiful Friday Harbor on San Juan Island in Puget Sound.  During a routine dive to check on Glaucus, a very special octopus, Ben is attacked and nearly killed.  The pace is set.<br /><br />Ben tries to send Haley a warning as he attempts to flee his attackers, and save his research data from the wrong hands.  Sanker Corp, owned by Henry Gardner Sanker, has its own security force headed by the psychopathic Officer Frick.  Ben has never trusted Frick and knows him to be behind his attack.  All he needs to know now is why, and how to stay alive.<br /><br />Ben's nephew Sam Wintripp is used to shady dealings, recuperating from almost fatal wounds in the San Juan's that he received in the line of duty.  Sam bumps into Haley at the same time he notices strangers on the island.  Haley receives Ben's garbled call and heads off to Sanker to check on him.  What she finds at Sanker is an irate Officer Frick who locks her in a closet.  Sam worries when Haley doesn't return his call, and sets out for Sanker himself, to check on her.<br /><br />Hang onto your seats, ladies and gentlemen, you are barely into the second chapter, and all h*ll has broken loose.  The action-filled story takes place in a twenty-four hour time span, and will leave you utterly breathless.  Ben is running for his life and trying to save the information he has uncovered; secrets that not only unlock the possibility of harvesting the deep methane layer under the ocean for fuel, but of a project he calls ARCS that could lengthen man's lifespan by decades.<br /><br />One of the people who desperately want Ben's secrets is Frick.  Dun has painted the perfect antagonist with Frick, ruthless, deadly, cold and emotionless; Frick will let nothing stand between him and his prize.  With Ben having slipped through his fingers, Frick relentlessly pursues Haley and Sam in a tension loaded chase from island to island, by land and sea and air.

Well, most of those books have had their proverbial fifteen minutes and gone back to the reserve shelves, but out of all of the sources of information I read then about life one-thousand years ago, this one is the best and has endured the longest in popularity.<br /><br />The Year 1000: What Life Was Like at the Turn of the First Millennium condenses what could have been a lengthy, dull read into an erudite crash course in daily life in England circa 1000 CE. I have high praise for this work of scholarly research, and haven't come across any other book that tells so much interesting history in so short a space.<br /><br />The authors also did a service to \\"Medieval\\" people by making them  something other than drooling bumpkins. In here we are told that, amazingly, the physical height of an eleventh-century Englishman exceeded that of his industrial age descendants, and was about on par with that of someone from the century just completed. Tooth decay was almost unknown due to a diet low in sugars, and people were typically in better shape and constitutionally more vigorous than we sedentary twenty-first century individuals.<br /><br />Humans living in England a millennium ago were a hardy lot who faced challenges and struggles that would have more than daunted modern men and women, and yet through intelligence and ingenuity, they prospered. Life expectancy was on the increase during the eleventh century, and so, gradually, was technological progress. Theirs was a world of unpolluted skies and dense forests that spread their natural beauty from one shore of Britain to the next. Unknown were toxic waste dumps, acid rain, urban sprawl and possible nuclear annihilation. If they had their plagues then, so do we today in the age of AIDS. If Vikings could appear on their beaches to wage destruction, the comparably modern people live in the dark shadow of bio-chemical terrorism.<br /><br />On the other side of the coin, this was also a time of aforementioned barbarian invasions, of superstition, near universal illiteracy, fascist-like control by the dominant religious institution, and nearly everyone dwelled in cruelest poverty, dependant on the eclectic fortunes of good harvest for their basic survival. Bathing was not a commonplace practice during this era, death in childbirth frighteningly mundane, medicine a hodgepodge mixture of surviving Hellenistic cures and folksy home remedies, and two children in five failed to see their tenth birthdays.<br /><br />No denying, in most ways we have it better today.<br /><br />This book describes all avenues of daily life, and even passes along some genuinely funny jokes and clever riddles contemporary to this period. The rhythms of the seasons and the distinctive characteristics of the months of the calendar year are featured, as are a few of the dominant figures who influenced England in that era. The authors impart such curious tidbits as the fact beer was universally drunk by child and adult alike, for its intoxicating effects as well as for its perceived nutritional properties. We are informed that salt and honey, hardly luxuries in our time, were so valued then they were even drafted as a means of currency. And end to end in this worthy book, the Medieval mindset is thoroughly probed as those living then struggled to fill in the gaps of their knowledge, sometimes creatively, frequently with concepts shocking to modern sensibilities. (The world was flat, the sun spun around the earth, thunderstorms were local rather than regional occurrences, and the stars were campfires of the saints in heaven.) We can laugh from our vantage point of a thousand years, but our modern world is founded upon the accomplishments of humans who came before us, including those from the year 1000, and it's humbling to gaze back at how we got to where we are now.<br /><br />A fine work!e we are now.  <br /> <br />A fine work!"	2005-08-31

I once heard Sylvia \\"cover\\" with a caller on a radio broadcast and questioned her credibility. I hadn't given much  thought to the afterlife with the exception of that I do not believe that a loving creator would punish us with a hell, especially after what some of us go through in this life. I've been skeptical of reports of near-death experiences and the like. Because I have a background in psychology and sociology, I wonder if the similarities in these reports simply result from the power of suggestion.    My husband's recent death impacted me far more than the death of other family and friends and raised many questions for me.  He was an incredible human being yet spent his last months agonizing over his destiny after death. I was angry that he had to suffer this on top of the chronic, terminal cystic fibrosis he'd lived with for his entire life.  I was, and still am, certain that he could not possibly go to any kind of a bad place. My mother, who had suffered a great deal of abuse and a terminal illness for the last twelve years of her life had gone through similar agony. I was with her at the moment of her death and will never forget the way she raised her eyebrows in  pleasant surprise three or four minutes after she had been pronounced dead. I decided to read Sylvia's book out of curiosity.    I was raised Catholic as well and have been Jewish, Baptist, Pentecostal, Assembly of God and Methodist. I returned briefly to Catholicism before coming permanently to a nature-based religion. Sylvia's arguments are fact-based and credible and I agree with her views even though we have different perceptions of the Divine.    In the first few chapters, Sylvia confirmed why I had to close my husband's eyes three times before I finally left his hospital room the night he died and also told me what had awakened me in the middle of the night two days after his death.  She confirmed that he is indeed very happy, well and very much alive.     I won't say that Sylvia's word is the final authority on death or the afterlife. I'm still a bit skeptical that anyone has actually been there and has come back to tell about it, so all we really have is thought and speculation. I sometimes wonder if some of the stories stem simply from the power of suggestion. I do believe that we can and do have contact with the spirit world and our departed loved ones - I've experienced it many times and as I get older, my own skills have developed.  I will say that Sylvia is far more credible than most and is definitely not a fraud. In this book, she mainly confirmed what I already knew in my heart. I feel that even if she turns out to be wrong in a few areas, she's as close to the truth as we're going to get. This book can be of tremendous comfort to the grieving."	2005-08-31

It is mostly based on the once British colony Hong Kong. Kenneth described every scene so vividly. This book is intelligent and original, deeply devout yet highly controversial.	2005-08-31

Prudence and twelve-year-old Dan were foundlings, and the dangers in a northern mill had pushed them into escape.  She also stripped a scarecrow for boy's clothes after a close encounter with a lustful farmer!  It was sheer bad luck they were in the way when Sebastian, Lord Wentworth's coach came bowling round the corner.  Sebastian took them up with him on his journey south into Kent, but Pru was sure of two things - he mustn't discover she was a girl, and she would continue to search for her family - no matter how her feelings kindled for Sebastian ...<br /><br />A Regency Delight!	2005-08-31

Alas, after getting about two thirds of the way through this novel (and that was a slog, I assure you!) I finally closed the covers and gave up.

It is an appalling portrayal of a dyslexic who is made to appear as thick as.  Great to out dyslexia in a heroine, but as so many dyslexics I have known of have worked so hard through verbal/aural skills to compensate, why have this heroine unable to do so?  eg she has the newspaper read to her by her sister, apparently a regular thing, yet is unable to recognise the word repealed, and believes a politician is having boys peeled!!!  Good grief, how unbelievable and how daft.  It's all a bit much to have the heroine have her betrothal hidden from her for a year, be laughed at by her family and by people in a courtroom and to have her husband have 3 illegitimate children....his attitude at the arrival of the 3rd says it all...he thinks she has wasted his time calling him home as to him it is not an emergency.

Her behavior is unconventional, but her fans love her that way.  She was lucky to be born into an era which takes for granted that our stars are going to have better sex than we do and do way more drugs.  Gone are the days when a career would be ruined if the gossip about, say, June Allyson's sex life had left the confines of Sunset Boulevard.<br /><br />I suppose there were always stars who played up their dark side, and made it a topic of unspoken agreement between themselves and their audience.  Robert Mitchum's pot bust back in 1948 didn't hurt his career because he could brazen it out so cheekily that we admire his gumption.  Simultaneously, no one ever mistook Lana Turner for a nun.  Pamela Anderson knows this territory better than anyone in America and she and her ghost writer Eric Shaw Quinn have combined the wilder sides of their own personalities and made Star just a little bit larger than life.  Take a cue from Jackie Susann, they make sure that the \\"roman a clef\\" portions of STAR STRUCK are never too difficult to solve.  People around America are wasting none of our valuable time wondering for long, \\"Gee, what show is LIFEGUARDS, INC\\"?<br /><br />If Pam wrote the book I'd be surprised, but when we saw her last year at the West Hollywood Book Fair promoting the first book, STAR, it seemed evident that she had at least read it.  This one has even more twists and turns, and Star's wonderful brother plays a large part in the plot; he should have a book of his own, he's dreamy.  Star and Jimi-the rock star boyfriend/husband with the oversized sex organ--get involved in a murder rap and a creepy stalker gets his ass handed to him-I thought that bit harsh.  Outside of that, STAR STRUCK is a book for those who love Pam, those who love cuddly animals, and people who just like to read about beautiful people having better sex than I do.

Perhaps it's my background as both an English major and a computer geek, but the book is a good, solid, enjoyable read. As some other reviewers have pointed out, there are times when the plot is too pat, when things just implausibly come together - but that seemed natural in this story where the computer game the protagonist (Edward) was playing seemed to mirror what was happening around him and what was happening in the story of this codex they were looking for. It may not have been a perfect weave, but the imperfections provided texture. The characters were quirky, interesting and Edward represented one or two guys we all know. Maybe the other reviewers don't know folks like this but Edward, Zeph and the other characters were familiar to me...maybe we all live in a separate, parallel, techno-geek reality of some kind, but I recommend this book to anyone interested in the disparate topics of computers and old English literature. And frankly, I was relieved that no one got beheaded, gored, set on fire or otherwise tortured a la Dan Brown's recent hits.	2005-08-31

Lynne does a great job of relating to teens by sharing her loss, and she also quotes real teenagers from camp in order to let teenagers know that others share the pain they are going through.

However, before Sir William Lewin will give approval to the match, he wants Michael to \\"retrieve\\" a scientific formula he claims his rival, Geoffrey Kenyon, has stolen. Disguised as a traveling tea merchant, Michael sets off on his unorthodox quest. Almost immediately he meets Kenyon's niece, Jocelyn, who enlists him in yet another masquerade. Even as Michael works towards attaining his goal of Ivy's hand, he finds himself falling under Jocelyn's spell. Soon Michael is knee deep in lies, plots and tea leaves.<br /><br />Liz Carlyle's HUNTING SEASON introduces us to the charismatic Christian Villiers, the Marquis of Grayston. Newly returned from exile in the Continent, Christian has come to England to destroy Denys Roth, the man responsible for his sister's suicide. To that end, Christian is attending a house party where he plans to seduce the woman Roth plans on marrying. However, instead of the worldly widow he had expected, Christian discovers Elise Middleton to be beautiful, virtuous and the stepmother of a little girl. Every stolen moment with her becomes heaven and hell for the haunted marquis. Somehow Elise becomes his hope of salvation even as he uses her to force a confrontation that will ruin any chance of happiness. When his machinations finally bring about a confrontation, Christian must look deep inside and make a final decision.<br /><br />Two authors, two stories, two totally different heroes. While all the elements for a great story were in place for Cathy Maxwell's novella, the main characters never fully grabbed this reader's attention. Both hero and heroine have been in love with other people for years yet their instant attraction to each other is supposed to excuse the rather fast shift in their affections. While most of the other characters appear one-dimensional and clich&eacute;d, the quaint English village does provide a cozy setting for all the plots being hatched. Perhaps if this had been a longer length story rather than a novella, Ms. Maxwell would have had a better chance at creating more sympathetic characters in this tepid tale. In direct contrast, Liz Carlyle's story of a marquis torn between finding salvation and delivering retribution is a poignant treat. Readers will empathize with this heroine torn between temptation and virtue and this hero struggling with demons from his past. Other guests at the house party provide interesting secondary stories. Ms. Carlyle's tale moves at a brisk pace, powered by an unforgettable pair of lead characters and a love affair that will leave you reaching for a tissue or two.<br /><br />TheSchemerimensional and clichd, the quaint English village does provide a cozy setting for all the plots being hatched.

"Red Prophet lives up to the expectations that I had after reading The Seventh Son.  All the wonderful things that I said about the first book continue to apply.  We get to see a \\"what-if\\" America where magic actually works, and our history is revealed in alternate ways (like George Washington having been executed at the start of the revolution).  This series has been a lifeline for me in the fantasy genra.<br /><br />The good of Red Prophet:<br />1) Alvin is finally coming into his powers a little.  No more accidental board splitting - now he runs to the melody of greensong and goes to places where no white man has ever been.<br />2) In this book, we run into historical celebrities like Napoleon, the Marquis De La Feyette, more from William Blake (Taleswapper), Andrew Jackson, and Tippy-Canoe Harrison.  Its neat seeing the writer's interpretation of these historical figures, and they were well done, if not completely accurately (as the author states about Harrison, for example).<br />3) The characters are never, every one dimensional.  The good guys aren't all good, and the bad guys - even the worst guys - have limits to their vileness.  In fact, there's an ever-present feeling of the power of redemption throughout this book which I found appealing.  I kept hoping that certain people would rise to the occasion - no spoilers though!<br /><br />The bad of Red Prophet:<br /><br />1)I would have liked to see even more of Taleswapper.  He's the most interesting side-character in the entire series.  I think Card avoids heavy usage of him because it requires incredibly diligent writing, and its just plain difficult.  And I totally appreciate his work here.<br />2) I was disappointed with Alvin's dad and brothers when they did \\"a certain act\\".  I thought that it was out of character and not really believable, and thus I felt led along a path, patiently counting the pages until the believable story began again."	2005-08-31

She has a few memories of her parents, but not many, and her only visitor has been \\"the Devil Man\\" once a year, for his obligatory check to see how she is doing. All she hopes for is an escape from this prison-type life she has at the orphanage, so she can go on a quest to find her family. This last time when her guardian comes to see her, she has a proposal for him, one that will benefit them both, and allow her to find her answers.<br /><br />Daniel St. John was not a happy man. The Guardianship of this woman-child was not something he wanted, but it can still be used for his own purposes. He has a plan that he needs her for, one that will find him revenge for something that happened many years ago, when he was not much more then a child himself. He intends to use her to reach his dreams of revenge and won't let anything get in his way.<br /><br />Daniel brings Diane home, claiming she is a cousin for propriety's sake. He begins to have her \\"dressed for the season,\\" preparing her for her role in his plans. Everything goes along according to his plans brilliantly, except for the fact that Diane has a mind of her own and her only goal is to find information about her family - she has no intention of staying with him any longer than is absolutely necessary. Daniel's scheming brings Diane to the attention of his rival, and his plan seems to be coming to fruition, all the while placing himself and Diane in danger.<br /><br />What he is not telling Diane, is that he has ties to her past he wishes to keep secret and those ties are related to his revenge. Unfortunately Daniel,  a famed seducer, never expected the biggest flaw in his plan... that he would fall under Diane's spell and by seduced by her innocence and beauty. Should she find out his secrets, he fears she would hate him for his role in what happened to her family, or that she had in the beginning, only been a pawn in his game.<br /><br />Ms. Hunter has once again proven why she is fast becoming a household name in the Romance genre.

It is an extremely well researched overview of ancient Greek history and culture. Quite scholarly, and written in an interesting way, he leads the reader through his research and thinking, not always giving definitive answers to cultural questions.  In the end the reader comes to fairly confident assumptions of what the Greek world was, and is, like.  His first chapters are quite good: Introduction, Formation of the Greek People, The Country, Homer, The Polis. The later chapters are less engaging, but overall a good scholarly read!<br /><br />Reviewed by David Lundberg, author of  [[ASIN:0976324644 Olympic Wandering: Time Travel Through Greece]]	2005-08-31

From the seed of a story about a magnificent and mysterious tree, in a way not unlike the Golden Spruce itself, John Vaillant's story grows into something much more than an interesting and informative book.<br />To help the reader fully understand the strange sequence of events, Vaillant's book is loaded with historical and factual detail, interwoven into a compelling and vital narrative. Rarely have I learned so much about things around me that have a direct impact on my life while fully enjoying the entire process.<br />The result is a fascinating and truly important book.

Although the author is not a widow herself she captures much of the essence of the experience of being a widow. She also introduces humor as a perspective.  <br /> <br />It may be that a 'new' widow, someone within a year of the loss of their spouse, may not be able to laugh at the humor. But as a woman well past her loss, I found much of it uproariously funny and freeing.  <br /> <br />It is not all about loss and sadness. It is also about change, movement, excitement, fear and hope.  <br /> <br />My only critique is that many women may find it unrealistic that the main character is able to accomplish so much within the first year of widowhood. That is often not  the case.	2005-08-31

She has powerful visions, not unlike those experienced by her mother, New Moon. These visions have always guided Dawn on the right path, and helped her to help those closest to her. When one of these visions tells her that her dearest childhood friend, Raven Cloud is in grave danger, she knows she must do all she can to protect him. Off she goes to England to find him and keep this danger from harming him. <br /> <br />Raven has spent the past several years of his life trying to forget his heritage. He is a half-breed savage who doesn't fit into the White man's world, or the red man's world. His hatred for the unknown man who sired him has stalked his whole life, forcing his exile from the Indian town where he grew up, Chota Town, and the family who raised him. His anger is a curse, causing him to head to England to try and find the man who fathered him, then left his mother. When dawn arrives, telling him she is there to protect him, his memories of the young girl she was do not gel with the woman he has become, distracting him from his self-imposed mission. <br /> <br />Someone is trying to harm him, and the reputation as a sound businessman he has tried to build. Many of his merchandise warehouses had been burned to the ground, costing the business lots if money. He knows someone is trying to jeopardize all Raven has built for himself in England. It concerns him that Dawn had a vision and wants to help him. She is a warrior woman, who will stop at nothing to protect the man she has claimed for her own. <br /> <br />Dawn's sole purpose is to find and eliminate the threat to Raven, before it can claim his life. She has loved him her whole life and knows he is the only man for her. But he scoffs at her attempts to help him and remind him of whom he really is. He is drawn to her as well, but refuses to accept her Cherokee ways and doesnot wish to draw her into the danger surrounding him, or his quest for vengeance. Dawn knows they are meant to be together, her visions have told her so, but how can she make Raven accept that as well? And how can she protect him when he is trying so hard to avoid her? Dawn finds her biggest job of all is to convince Raven to acknowledge his heritage, before they can be together for always. <br /> <br />This was a compelling read, from the pen of Mary Adair. Golden Dawn is quite the warrior, willing to go to great lengths to protect her man. Nothing can stop her from reaching her goals. Raven is consumed by his hatred of the man who fathered him and scorns his native heritage. Only dawn has the power to break through to him, all the more reason for him to try to keep his distance. These two are perfect for each other, obvious to the reader, even though Raven himself refuses to admit it. <br /> <br />There is a good deal of suspense in this novel, and the mystery underlying everything is engrossing. One will make numerous guesses to who is the guilty party, changing their mind repeatedly, until the surprise of who exactly it is. Also of note, is Raven's quest for his father. One will be stunned to find out who it is, though in the end, the reader will be surprised at not figuring it out sooner. A touch of the mystical is evident as well, in Dawn's powers of foresight and her ability to sometimes bring on a vision at a moment's notice. <br /> <br />This is a good story, not as gripping for this reviewer as some other books read, but still kept the interest until the end. Ms. Adair shows promise as a writer and this reviewer would be interested to see how future books pan out for the author. <br /> <br /> Kelley A. Hartsell, September 2002.

I recently completed William Shirer's \\"The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,\\" and Lutzer's book is a necessary complement to that longer work because the author focuses specifically on the spiritual struggle that was covering Germany. As Scripture states, the real battle is not so much against flesh and blood as against satanic forces and the rule of evil in this world. Lutzer concentrates on this critical arena and brings to light some fascinating insights that many other authors ignore or gloss over. <br /> <br />Personally, the book hit home on a number of levels. By and large, the organized church in Germany pitifully cow towed to the Nazi regime, bowing the head while Hitler tried to destroy Christianity by wedding it to the satanically political force that was Nazism. It basically came down to power -- if Hitler could restore Germany to its former glory, the church, by and large, was willing to give up all that was sacred. That's a chilling reality when you look at modern day America. How many churches in Germany were silent while Jews and other enemies of the Third Reich were shipped off to concentration camps, yet how many churches here in America offer no protest when our national collectively murders 45 million unborn children? The same atrocity that engulfed the church in Germany is being faced by the church in America. Are we going to sit idly by in our prosperity while such a great injustice occurs? It's a probing question.  <br /> <br />I also found Lutzer's description of Dietrich Bonhoeffer's heroic stand against Nazism quite moving. Indeed, if a man gains the whole world and yet loses his soul, what good is it to him? Hitler is dead and gone now, thankfully in the power of an almighty God; Bonhoeffer is also gone, but he shall live eternally with his Lord. It's a glorious thought toknow that on the day of the Lord, I will embrace such a man as a brother, through the grace of Jesus Christ alone. <br /> <br />\\"Hitler's Cross\\" is definitely worth reading for both believers and non-believers. It sheds new light on the holocaust America is going through and really convicts one of the necessity to stand for truth, regardless of what lies the spirit of the age is propagating. The question is: Will we Christians in America have the commitment to our Lord to stand, as Bonhoeffer did, even when it might cost us everything? <br />"	2005-08-31

"First: I am not pleased about the blatant sexism in a couple of the reviews that preceed mine (you bought the book because there's an almost naked woman on the cover with the most incredible hair you've ever seen and then you were disappointed?? Sounds like you expected to sit back and take a taste and instead got offended because the author is a serious thinker, humorist and political theorist, and not your personal sex doll. And to the other reviewer: Kerry and Clinton would be ashamed to have her as a daughter??? Who could possibly care what Kerry or Clinton would think of the author, and why are YOU thinking of the author as someone's daughter? The obvious likelihood, and I'm amazed you didn't think of it, is that Clinton would react to Aschenbrand like the other reviewer I mention above, and probably not as a \\"father.\\" Also, given Clinton's obvious inclination toward having sex with women who are not his wife--not that I'm judging him--, I think it's hilarious that you use him as an example of a puritanical father figure! So in your mind, men can do anything--including being involved in a public sex scandal of major proportions--and still be role models doling out judgments about female behavior. But if a woman, an author, uses \\"foul\\" language in her book then the world falls apart and we should all start worrying about what all the fathers of the universe will think. Yik. What if I read a book by Hunter S. Thompson and then lowered the boom by saying that Sen. Hillary Clinton would be ashamed to have him as a son? I would sound like an imbecile, wouldn't I? Yes, I would. Guess what? Stop thinking about the author as a sex object or a bad daughter and you might be able to enjoy the book and learn something from it. Aschenbrand is a major talent who weaves the stuff of her daily life into a sharp and hilarious social critique. She launches insightful and liberating perspectives from the margins (of sexual orientation, ethnic identity, gender, etc), and consequently gives us a chance to see things with new eyes. And all the while, the narrative voice is engaging and open, even loving. What an accomplishment. I was on a plane when I read the book and I laughed out loud so many times that I'm sure people thought I was crazy. But I was just thrilled to be reading The Only Bush I Trust Is My Own.

Matthew over came his childhood and stern upbringing to break out of the mold of his father's tutulege and become a political thinker. <br />      <br />Allen Tate, a member of the Vanderbilt 'Fugitives' group of poets, preferred Matthew Arnold to Browning or Tennyson. Now, in English Lit., I liked Browning; my favorite poem was ABOU BEN ADHEM. In Birmingham, England, in the farmland and English Midlands, young Arnold was born in 1822. He was the eldest son of \\"the greatest Headmast who ever lived\\" who had his own Rugby School. Rugby, Tennessee, here in the beautiful mountains of East Tennessee was built on the principle of this stern headmaster, a communal farming project, which failed in the United States. It is steeped in history and still has the crudely built houses with their own small library. They were English intellectuals, not farmers. They were the first organic farmers in this area, near Oneida -- so high it's the closet place to Heaven I've ever been. <br /> <br />Matthew became a brilliant 'elegiac' poet of poets who helped to form the 'modern consciousness' with his comparative attitude to problems in Western society and culture. His carrer was a study in \\"sensitivity, courage and endurance.\\" Strange for a rebel of the family to excel at literary endeavors, as he opposed his unpoetic father. <br /> <br />Matthew had been lucky in his marriage and lucky with is teachers and friends, an Archbishop of Canterbury, Wordsworth and Browning. His son, Dick shared a passion for family, which had been one secret of Matthew Arnold's success, <br /> <br />He became a poetry professor in 1857, wrote \\"Essays in Criticism\\" in 1862 and \\"Culture and Anarchy\\" in 1866. His \\"The Forsaken Merman\\" inspired Sylvia Plath. <br /> <br />Mrs. Arthur Claugh, wife of one of his good friends, in London kept every item in Matthew's room \\"just as he had left it\\" and \\"waiting\\" as a memorial to a great and beloved poet of the ages across the pond."	2005-08-31

"Th French Diet is an enjoyable read and does contain a few molecules of truth. Unfortunately, the French Diet is misleading in that it does not tell the whole story of why the French people have lower rates of heart disease, and are less overweight and obese than Americans. The book is \\"politically correct\\" in that the author does not explain that, for the most part, the French reject the lipid hypothesis, which is the belief that saturated fat and cholesterol cause heart disease. Montignac over-emphasizes the role of olive oil in the French diet. Although the French do consume (and produce) large quantities of olive oil, they also consume large quantities of butter, cream, full-fat yogurt, raw-milk cheese, and duck fat. These foods are all high in saturated fat, contradicting the authors claim that the French consume primarily monounsaturated fats. The author also neglects to mention the ugly fact that the French smoke more than Americans and the potential impact this has on caloric intake."	2005-08-31

Issues arise immediately with the ex-husband, her sister, and the proximity of an American writer who's too sexy for her peace of mind.<br /><br />There are elements of chick lit here with some self-deprecating humor, also some standard romance fare, and yet, it pulls together to be even more than either of those genres.

Ultimately, it helped her let go. <br />She reflected back on her journal and realized the need for a book of this nature. Many people reject or ignore the facts of AIDS. She thought her personal journal might be helpful to someone else facing a similar battle with AIDS. She shares her thought process during a trying time and offers ways for readers to reach out.

However, the page-by-page annotations are repetitive (I don't need *constantly* to be told that \\"Life as film is a recurring theme\\") and often assume the readers have spent their entire lives in a cave (I *know* who Ringo Starr and Richard Nixon are, thanks!).  At the same time, missing from the annotations is any serious discussion (beyond brief mentions) of chaos magic, anarchist theory or other key themes and influences.  The authors' one-paragraph reviews of each issue occasionally contain genuine insight, but more often focus on praising or nitpicking the artists' work, fanboy-style.  Surely in such a profound work as *The Invisibles* it's the writing that's of primary importance?    This guide merits two extra stars:  one for the helpful, editorially neutral issue-by-issue plot summaries which clear up many ambiguous moments in the series; and one for the engrossing Morrison interview at the end.  Interested readers should consult the Invisibles section of Barbelith online and the Grant Morrison pages on Disinformation online;  you'll find much more intelligent discussion than found in this guide."	2005-08-31

Zahir was among the top zines, and it had a wide range of advertised fiction.  So I dived in and ordered a copy.<br /><br />Within a few days, the issue arrived in the mail.  The magazine is put together nicely.  There is no advertising.  The binding and layout is well done.  Overall, I am satisfied with the content of the magazine.  I include details on each story below (WARNING SPOILERS):<br /><br />BIRTHDAY ROOMS, by William Alexander<br /><br />A surreal tale about a boy who encounters himself at different ages on his birthday in his uncle's house.  The interaction between the different aspects of the same character is interesting and well thought out.  I found myself drawn along with interest.  Well done.<br /><br />THE PETTY PACE, by Brian A. Dixon<br /><br />More of a science fiction-style story, the story is written in the first person, and it is definitely subjective whether it is true or not.  The characters see the end of existance within the day and have to deal with this knowledge.  As a fan of this kind of fiction, it was particularly well conceived and executed.<br /><br />A SHADOW IN POUGHKEEPSIE, by Reggie J. Poche<br /><br />Another rather surreal story, I did not follow this story as well.  In it, the characters are in a halfway house; ex-cons trying to find a new lives for themselves.  A box arrives on the doorstep for the main character that contains memories for all of the significant events in his life.  He seems to be able to reshape his past, but I am not positive and believe the actual results of the story were left open.  On this story, I do not think the resolution was as solid.<br /><br />UNPREPARED, by Karen Pierce Gonzalez<br /><br />Now this is an interesting piece about a girl names Unprepared, who has to grow up with her cosmic mystical mother while she is more grounded.  The story is one of growth, the mother-daughter relationship and of being balanced.  Though not as surreal or fantastic as some of the other stories, it was strange in the details of what could have been real.  I enjoyed it and saw the resolution to be solid and fulfilling.<br /><br />GLASS, by Miranda Schmidt<br /><br />A shorter story than most of the others, it is a fantastical tale about a girl that sees a mouth in a pane of glass and becomes obsessed with this mouth and what it is attached to.  You get a definite sense of an otherworld in the story, but nothing is explained, as the reader, you simply experience - which is cool.  A nice story with a engaging obsession.<br /><br />THE MUG HOUSE, by James W. Morris<br /><br />The voice of the narrator of this story is strong, as it is a barkeep telling the reader (a patron at the bar), a story.  It is about a guy who comes in and offers a guy who is down on his luck to purchase his reflection.  The story is rather realistic and has interesting details.  The story stretches what might have happened and what really happened in good ways.  Overall, it was an engaging story with an intriguing twist.<br /><br />A STRANGE NIGHT IN THE COUNTRYSIDE, by Reumynd y Cyfarwydd<br /><br />A strange tale seemingly set in Victorian England, you find a girl that is going out to the countryside to rest because her relatives think she is too wild.  Through the course of the story, she ends up taking a rather fantastic trip which includes a rampaging bath tub, witches and faeries.  As an accounting, I found the story to be engaging, but the end left me wanting.<br /><br />BETWEEN NOW AND TRINE, by Nels Hanson<br /><br />A strange tale about a girl who has been dumped and is coping with it by descending into a fantasy world.  Whether that fantasy world is real or not is the unanswered question of the story.  The story and characters were interesting.  At times, I wonder whether it was really a story.  Though it has a resolution, I do not see the appropriate lead-in to that resolution.<br/><br />RIVER BRINGS ALL, by Jill Zeller<br /><br />Now this is a strange story.  Black helicopters.  Jesus allusions.  Flooding.  Obsession with details.  A depressing and forlorn character.  I am not quite sure what to make of it.  Perhaps I am not supposed to make anything of it.  Either way, it is short and intriguing.  Definitely strange (I think I already said that).<br /><br />CARDS, by Ron Melton<br /><br />A circular tale about a man's life during the Civil War and afterward.  The story resonates interestingly within itself, but you do not feel much investment in the main character.  The story is intriguing, but it feels too dependent on the trick of the plot.<br /><br />Overall, I like the magazine.  It was worth the five bucks.  The stories were mostly quick to read.  I would recommend giving this magazine a try.ils.  A depressing and forlorn character.  I am not quite sure what to make of it.  Perhaps I am not supposed to make anything of it.

Atwood creates highly sympathetic female characters and then places them in the most heart-wrenching of circumstances. Their story is cleverly laid out, with a well-structured plot. I found myself immersed in Offred's world, needing to know her fate. <br /> <br />However, unlike many women, I did not find the Handmaid's Tale frightening. Some have said that we are on the verge of such a society, only one disaster away. I say that's baloney. Women in the West today have more opportunities and rights than at any time in history, and more power. We are blessed to live in such times. <br /> <br />Gender discrimination and sexual exploitation do exist: they are very real evils, even in America. However, we in the West, especially America, have a tendency to cry \\"discrimination\\" and \\"oppression\\" at the drop of the hat. The Handmaid's Tale plays on this tendency-a tendency which makes us look like spoiled fools to the truly oppressed women of the world. If not for this book's alarmist undertone, I would have given it four stars."	2005-08-31

There were things I liked about it, but then again, there were things that just annoyed me about it.<br /><br />When I saw the cover on this book my first thought was \\"gorgeous\\". But I found myself looking at the cover again and again as I read the story. As much as I like the picture of Cherif Fortin on the cover, it was completely wrong for the book since the hero, Alexander, was described as being a blond. One of my huge pet peeves...why can't the cover match the characters?<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me was the constant bickering and planning the heroine did. Sure, she didn't want to be married to the hero, wanted to marry a cousin of hers but that didn't stop her from turning to putty each time the hero touched her. And always, right after they did, she would tell him she never wanted him to touch her and she hated him. Why do they do that? That's another pet peeve of mine...the love/hate relationship and the constant fighting.<br /><br />At times the heroine acted like a spoiled little girl and I kept thinking the hero could probably find someone else much better than her.

"I hate to write a negative review of a well-meaning book that tries as hard as this one.  But I have to warn away readers lured in by comparisons to favorites like \\"Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler\\" and \\"The Westing Game.\\"  The sad truth is that \\"Chasing Vermeer\\" is a bit of a mess, with no rhyme or reason, no real mystery to piece together, and an unsatisfying ending. <br /> <br />Here's the problem: in tone, style and premise, this book sets up in the tradition of classic interlocking character puzzle-mysteries like \\"The Westing Game\\" and \\"Holes.\\"  But in fact, there are no puzzle pieces to fit together.  Every revelation...I mean EVERY...comes about through hunches, visions, \\"just somehow knowing,\\" or absurdly unlikely coincidences.  That would be fine, if it were supposed to be a supernatural adventure story.  (In fact, that could have been a terrific book: a spine-tingling supernatural adventure about kids who can communicate with the characters in a stolen painting.)  But the author is convinced that she's spinning a logical mystery, and so the whole thing falls apart.  At the end, there is no satisfying ca-chunk of everything clicking into place.  Some of the explanations given for events in the book are kludgey to the point of embarassment. <br /> <br />A suggestion for fans of this type of book: dig deeper into \\"Westing Game\\" author Ellen Raskin.  \\"The Tattooed Potato and Other Clues\\" is a fabulous puzzle-mystery, criminally out of print but available in libraries.  \\"Figgs and Phantoms\\" is funny and mysterious, but also extremely personal and strange.  It has a more supernatural and even philosophical/spiritual bent that's surprisingly moving."	2005-08-31

The Victorian equivalent of a gigolo except that word hadn't been invented yet.  A renowned lover famous for his ability to satisfy women.  He was the darling of society until ghosts from his past came back to destroy him.  Now scarred for life, Michael is out to seek vengeance and must draw his enemies out.  To do that, he will need Anne Aimes.  Anne is an extremely wealthy spinster who has always been fascinated by the infamous Michael.  Deciding that she would like to experience the joys of carnal pleasure without marrying, Anne hires Michael for one month.  Each enters into the agreement with ulterior motives and soon realize that they had gotten much more than they had bargained for.<br /><br />Robin Schone has written a book that is guaranteed to evoke strong emotions.  One can't help but feel empathy and admiration for Anne, a creature of her time who is bold enough to shake off the shackles of convention and reach for what she wants.  As for Michael, his story is heartbreaking and not easily forgotten.  Robin brings these two characters to life in a fashion that is vivid and poignant.  She pushes the story to its very limits then takes that final step over the line.  The result?  A story that leaves an indelible mark.  THE LOVER is not an easy book to read - it's intense, disturbing, and definitely not for the faint of heart.  All that aside, rarely has a book satisfied me on so many levels.  THE LOVER pushed all the right buttons.  My copy is firmly ensconced on my Keeper Shelf.<br /><br />TheSchemer	2005-08-31

"My 5-year-old daughter took to _First Language Lessons_, a grammar book for 1st-2nd grade, right away and with great enthusiasm.  The format is one that has worked for us in other subjects (similar to Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons and Saxon Math), and she enjoyed learning about nouns.  By the fourth or fifth lesson, she could easily recite the definition of a noun.  So when I opened the book for lesson 11, I figured we'd be about due for something new.  I said as I opened the book, \\"Let's see what we'll learn today.\\" <br /> <br />Nouns. <br /> <br />\\"MORE nouns?\\" my daughter opined. <br /> <br />\\"More nouns,\\" I said, disbelieving.  \\"Let me look and see when we'll start working on something new.\\" <br /> <br />So I flipped ahead . . . to lesson 50, where pronouns are introduced. <br /> <br />There are FORTY-NINE consecutive lessons on NOUNS?   <br /> <br />The author of this book seems to have mastered the idea of =review=, but failed miserably at the idea of regularly introducing something new to keep the student's interest, while still reviewing prior material (as is done in Teach Your Child to Read and Saxon Math).  FORTY-NINE consecutive lessons on nouns?  My daughter will HATE grammar well before we make it that far, if I don't give her something new to work on! <br /> <br />As an author myself, I know how critical it is that a book not only cover the requisite material, but =organize= it effectively, and that is where First Language Lessons fails.  The material is covered, and it is presented in an appropriate manner -- one that could be very effective -- but it is not organized in a way that will maintain the child's interest while reinforcing learned concepts.  This is a shame.  I would love to see a new edition of this book, reorganized in a more effective way."	2005-08-31

A mix of fantasy, historical fiction and mystery, the novel is at times entertaining but still failed to deliver on its promise.  Moredun is at his best when he's weaving the mystery plotline in historical turn-of-the-century England.  A police officer is investigating the mysterious deaths of women - all of whom were pregnant, in 1895.  His story dovetails in with the story of a boy in 1910 a boy - James - who stumble through a portal and into another world called Eldaterra that lies alongside our own.  Magic still exists in Eldaterra, and a war is brewing that will spill over into our world.  Moredun's fantasy world was disappointing - too obvious a rip-off of Tolkien and the like.  His \\"bad guys\\" were olorcs, an obvious play on Tolkien's orcs, and he avoids having to give them real motives by postulating a world where good is good and evil is evil.  HIs good guy was, of course, a wizard in a tower.  His \\"bad guys\\" in 1910 are, of course, German, a not very original idea.  He also frequently neglects to describe his characters, (I counted at least four major characters that were never described) or does so in the vaguest of terms that make it hard to picture them.  The story still has its entertaining moments, and fans of fantasy that aren't too critical will probably enjoy it, anyway.  But I was hoping for something more when I picked it up and I wouldn't recommend it."	2005-08-31

The horror!\\"--Kurtz's last words or the reader's thoughts during Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness?  Somehow Conrad makes the one hundred pages of Heart of Darkness feel like three hundred.  It could be the thin story which is dragged out too long.  The constant stream of unnecessarily complex vocabulary does not help the book either.  Overall, Heart of Darkness leaves the reader feeling bored and insulted by the simple extended metaphor of the dark jungle and human morals. <br /> <br /> The story is told by Marlow, Conrad's alter ego.  He rambles about his experience as captain of a merchant ship and meticulously explains every detail of its trip up a jungle river.  This is painfully slow to read, but does build tension as the expedition gets closer to its final destination, a man named Kurtz.  Kurtz is a legend among the workers in the ivory trade, and the reader's curiosity is provoked by the rumors told about him.  In the end Marlow has to confront Kurtz and his own beliefs of human morality. <br /> <br /> Quite possibly the worst part of Heart of Darkness is Conrad's grotesque overuse of gaudy terminology.  Most sentences are clogged with bizarre words that only cause the reader to misinterpret the text.  This makes the novel highly inaccessible to any reader that is not of higher education.  Conrad's writing is dated, making his point come across less clear than it may have one hundred years ago. <br /> <br /> Heart of Darkness makes a disturbing point about human corruptibility.  However I feel the effectiveness of this point is lost in the length of the novel.  While the raw lack of humanity is moving, I found myself too bored to care for the majority of the novel.  Heart of Darkness should have been a short story.  I was captivated by Kurtz at the end of the novel, but it may have just been my knowledge that the conclusion was near.  Joseph Conrad wrote a powerful story, too bad it is so verbose and lingering that it drives back possible readers. <br />"	2005-08-31

"Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />Ms. Gable has written another story bound to tug at the heartstrings.<br /><br />Rachel Thompson has a broken heart. Her young son had died in an accident, but she had donated his organs so other children could live. Unfortunately, the agony of her loss tears at her, interfering with her career as a schoolteacher, and her ability to continue to live on with the memory of her son. In a last ditch effort to deal with her pain, and save her job, she volunteers for the summer at Camp Firefly Wishes, a special camp for transplant children and their families. She has no desire to be there, all of those children being memories of her little boy.<br /><br />James McClain is a single father first, a psychologist second, with an eight-year-old daughter, Molly, who is the recipient of a new heart. His wife left him when she could not handle the pressures of raising a daughter with a severe, life-endangering heart defect. He is terrified of anything happening to Molly, going to the extremes to protect her, to the point of excess. Molly only wants to have a normal summer with other children her age.<br /><br />When James and Rachel meet, they are both attracted to each other, though they are both in denial. Rachel has so much pain, she has no desire to take interest in anyone, especially a man who with his daughter, embodies Rachel's worst nightmare, that of losing a child. James cares only about keeping Molly healthy and safe and has no interest in a woman who seems cold in her inability to accept the children at this camp for what they are, little miracles of life running around. In fact, in spite of his attraction, he wants to hate her for her attitude. Molly likes Rachel, in spite of the sadness in her eyes and heart, and decides she is the perfect woman to get her Dad to loosen up and let her have some fun.<br /><br />So Molly schemes with her best friend, to throw her dad and Miss Rachel together as often as possible, hoping that would be enough of a distraction to give her some time for fun. But the more she gets to know Miss Rachel, the more Molly decided she is the perfect candidate to be her new Mommy. It works too, for a while, her Dad and Miss Rachel seem to get along so well. But after James discovers Rachel's real reason for being at Camp Firefly Wishes, he begins to doubt even more whether she could handle the pressures of being a parent to a child with a severe illness.<br /><br />Can Rachel get past her fear of loving and losing another child dear to her? Will James accept her, faults and all, to be a part of his family? Will Molly's own private firefly wishes be enough to bridge the gap?<br /><br />This is one phenomenal story so full of emotion that one is captured in its pages. Ms. Gable has a talent for weaving so much feeling in to her books, the reader is bound to be moved. When Rachel finally lets go of all her anger and pain, her agony is so real, this reviewer was brought to tears. That, in this reviewer's opinion, is the mark of a truly incredible story - one that the reader is so drawn into, the emotions of the characters become the reader's own. And that is just one example of the emotion throughout the story.<br /><br />Rachel and James need each other, and everyone can see that but the two of them. For only they together can heal the emotional scars they each wear. The chemistry between them is tangible and one knows they are bound to be together. The supporting cast complements them, from the indomitable and \\"unsinkable\\" Molly, to Rachel's family, to Molly and James' best friends, and the camp owners.

"The author-slash-huckster's talent for assaulting the eye is perhaps only exceeded by a knack for self-promotion that even Ron Popeil would be proud of.    <br /> <br />From the first page--nay, the dustjacket--\\"Goodbye, Gutenberg...\\" promises to be a stroll down Self-congratulation Lane, followed by a long saunter along Arrogance Avenue.  Just as we should be wary of Franklin Mint trinkets touted by the manufacturer as valuable, limited edition collectibles, we should be cautious about a book so heavily praised by its own author.  The blurb inside of the back, imploring the browser to buy this, one of only 4700 first editions (of course, she does promise many more printings), makes me wonder if Ms Kirschenbaum is trying to launch a writer's revolution or line her pockets.   <br /> <br />Similar books, she confides, sell for as much as $100 or more.  But you can get your copy of \\"Goodbye Gutenberg...\\" for the low, low price of only $47.95!  I am only surprised she didn't promise to include an individually numbered certificate of authenticity and a handsome, mahogany-finish display cabinet.  Or that she didn't tell us to wait, there's more!  If you act now, you can receive a second copy at no additional cost!  And if you order within the next ten minutes, she'll throw in an amazing instant meat defroster for free, so you'll never have to wait three hours for your chicken to thaw out again!  That's a total retail value of over $125, but only if you order today!  (Sorry, no C. O. D.'s.) <br /> <br />The blatantly commercial aspects of the work aside, \\"Goodbye Gutenberg...\\" is a visual nightmare.  For countless years, writers have worked alone or in collaboration with designers to produce works that, through a combination of good writing and engaging graphic design, strengthen the reader's comprehension of the information therein.  The key of these works' success seems to be that the reader synthesizes the text and graphics without being more aware of one or the other,allowing each to enhance the value of the other.  Unfortunately, \\"Goodbye...\\" slaps the reader with its distracting and confusing computer-generated visuals and then whispers its information with a soft and easily missed sans serif font (a neo-Comic Sans MS affair designed by (who else?) the author).   <br /> <br />I saw this work in a bookstore and tried to give it a chance, but found it to be an astonishingly taxing read.  While I don't claim that minimalism is the only way to go, there is certainly a lot to be said for elegance and knowing what it means to be \\"over the top.\\" <br /> <br />I strongly suspect this is the first published work of its kind for one of two reasons:  1) no other person alive has had enough free time to see such an unwieldy, pointless project to fruition; 2) such works exist, but no publishing house has previously dared print them.   <br /> <br />Incidentally, unless Ms Kirschenbaum is trying to revolutionize the act of printing, I am not sure why she bids farewell to Gutenberg, who pioneered the printing press, not the aesthetics of books."	2005-08-31

I lost my copy, and for the last month or two my daughter and I have been remembering bits and pieces about the plot. We knew that we wanted to \\"re-read\\" the book, but couldn't remember the author or title. A recent replay of \\"Murder List\\" provided the hint I needed to find this, and the memory was compelling enough to pay for a new copy. It's at least as good as I remembered. (Having a very bad memory only comes in handy when it comes to re-reading books. Give me a year, and it's practically a new story!)"	2005-08-31

When she was six, someone killed her family, but made one mistake; the assailant thought she was dead too.  Rookie police officer Craig Denver comforted the child and over the tears provided support to her.<br /><br />For the past decade, Cass has served as a cop turned detective with Bowers Inlet, New Jersey, headed by Craig.  Suddenly in the past week four homicides occurred by the same person who has taunted Craig with notes just like the Bayside Strangler did twenty plus years ago.  Craig and Cass know they are out of their league so ask for help from the FBI.  Special Agent Rick Cisco works with Cass and Denver while Special Agent Mitchell Peyton is dispatched to the home of writer Regan Landry, daughter of a recently famous bestselling true crime author to see if he had information on the Bayside Strangler and hopefully a lead to stop Bowers Inlet killer.<br /><br />Though this is the first novel of the Truth mini series, Mariah Stewart's fans will recognize some of the law enforcement characters from the previous Dead tale leading to the feeling that crime never sleeps.  The story line is action-packed as the beleaguered local cops and their outside allies struggle with time slipping into the future summer tourist rush, which could mean an exponential increase in homicides.  There is romance in the tale, but that takes a back seat to a strong serial killer police procedural that will leave Ms. Stewart's grateful but frightened audience leaving lights on 24/7.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner"	2005-08-31

I guess this is a good thing because I was able to read and enjoy this book without any preconceived notions on Richard's guilt or inocence.<br /><br />With that being said, I have to say that this is the BEST historical fiction that I have read thus far.  I learned that much time, research and effort went into the making of this first novel by SKP and it really shows.  For me, never has a historical story been so informative yet so entertaining.  As one reviewer wrote, you do not have to love historical fiction in order to enjoy this book.<br /><br />SKP did a great job in her description of those times that even when I was reading about the many battles fought I was never bored (that is a plus, considering I hate anything to do with war).  She made all her characters, even minor ones, come to life by giving them a voice.  While reading this story you either come away hating or loving a character. By the end of this book I could not contain my sadness at how it all ends.  I can't remember any other book that has made me cry or feel depressed because of the ending.  The love story between Anne Neville and Richard York was not only awe inspiring but heartbreaking.  It is this and all betrayal, envy, loyalty, deceit, honesty and all other range of human emotions that make this book unforgettable.<br /><br />What is truly remarkable about this book is that it helped me realize that the wars that we fight today are the same wars fought so long ago.  We would like to delude ourselves into thinking that we are fighting for freedom and peace but the grim reality is that we are mainly fighting for power and because of greed.  It seems that we are doomed to repeat past mistakes.<br /><br />Thanks SKP for bringing this wonderful story to life - it is one that I will not soon forget.  Mitzi	2005-08-31

Actually he has a naturalistic stake in this evolution-creation struggle.  <br /> <br />He wants to keep science pure from any \\"religious miracles\\" but doesn't bother to maintain the ultimate \\"naturalistic miracle\\": the universe, with its astonishing macro and micro complexity, has no ultimate cause!!! Galaxies, stars, \\"quasars\\", \\"blasars\\", planets, the solar system, aminoacids, proteins, molecular machines, DNA-RNA, cells, thousands of different perfectly functional organisms, all evolved out of nothing, by purely random processes, against all mathematical and probabilitistic odds!! That's remarkable, for someone who says he doesn't believe in miracles. For Michael Ruse - who has been around and seen enough - this naturalistic miracle can stay, even against all evidence, because it doesn't bring God in to the picture. Apparently, he doesn't dare to question evidence of design in nature, but it is clear he doesn't want to face off with the Designer.  <br /> <br />According to this view, Christian faith can only hold on as long as it stands the test of modern science. For Michael Ruse, evolutionism is an unquestioned paradigm, that should be used to evaluate all religious doctrines. For Michael Ruse, science and religion remain separated, and evolutionists, such as Richard Dawkins, should not cross the border line that keeps them separated. Religion and biblical creationism are, a priori, considered as epistemologically inferior, according to the rules of the game establioshed by naturalists, because they are not based on the observations and rational theorizations of men.  <br /> <br />As plausible as this may seem to those who have been mercilessly indoctrinated by modern rationalism, this view is in reality totally flawed.  <br /> <br />The point is that Biblical Creationism is perfectly scientific, because is based in the observations and rational activities of a perfectly moral and rational God, the Creator. The fact that we consider ourselves rational and expect rationality from this world comes from this foundational understanding. We cannot base our expectations of order, intelligibility, mathematical beauty of relativity equations, and golden proportions on random and purely accidental processes and assumptions.  <br /> <br />It is true that, from the point of view of modern human science, it seems totally absurd to start a scientific inquiry by relying on a Sacred Book. I know what naturalism is all about and do understand these feelings. After all, the argument goes, science should rely only on observation, hipothesis building, experimental testing, conclusion formulating, theory building and paradigm constructing. So why rely a priori on a Sacred text?  <br /> <br />My answer to this would be:  <br /> <br />A) Every observation is based on a priori assumptions. These may be either a belief in a Creator or a belief that nature is all there is. Evolutionists cannot do without a priori assumptions.  <br /> <br />B) The origin of the Universe is not observable. No one was there to watch. If there is a God, then He is the only reliable witness to the process of Creation. You can only start with some form of Revelation or with your own speculations and extrapolations. In this light, the Bible is a good starting point, because of its inherent plausibility from a scientific, historical, anthropological moral and spiritual perspectives, all of which have been tested in many different contexts and times.  <br /> <br />C) Observations are incomplete. Many astronomers are now saying that we may never understand the origins, since the speed of light and microwave background radiation may have been influenced by many astronomical events that we may never be able to observe and understand. Others, think they can put forward a theory of everything by sayingthat out Universe is one in millions of previous or parallel universes, as if it wasn't hard enough just to explain our Universe.  <br /> <br />D) The same observations are able to generate hundreds of different theories. So we may ask: how will we ever now if we have come up with the right explanation? If we don't know the truth in advance, if our observations are conditioned by a priori assumptions, limited and able to generate multiple theories and models, how will we be able to recognize the true explanation when we see it?  <br /> <br />For these reasons, it seems to me that it makes complete sense to start with the Bible, with its model of special creation a few thousand years ago, fall and curse, global flood, Babel, dispersion and rapid speciation. I know this may be a humbling experience to modern proud rationalism and naturalism. But then, so what? True wisdom and knowledge about the origins of a created world starts inevitably with the revelation of the Creator. It is absolutely reserved for the Creator to establish the epistemological rules of the origins game. If we don't accept these rules, we lose.  <br /> <br />Although this epistemological humbling experience may prima facie sound utterly unscientific and repugnant to the modern mind, it makes perfect sense because it tells what we should look for and expect to find, as any other scientific model would. In this sense, the Bible is scientific because it helps us to make many predictions. Remember that even Stephen Jay Gould had to admit that biblical creationism does indeed make predictions.  <br /> <br />For instance, the Bible predicts states of affairs such as:  <br /> <br />1) all species of the flora and fauna belong to separate genera, so we should not expect to find intermediate links in the fossil record, in molecular biology and in the living world.  <br /> <br />2) since all species were created by the same Creator, they are expected to show relevant genetic, structural and functional similarities and be dependent on each other.  <br /> <br />3) since Man was created in the image of God, we should expect the fine-tuning of the Universe for life, with many \\"antropic coincidences\\".  <br /> <br />4) since all creatures were created by an Omnipotent and Omniscient God, we should expect overwhelming signs of complex specified information and intelligent design in the macro and in the micro universe.  <br /> <br />5) since all species were created by a Omniscient and Omnipotent God, we should expect systems and mechanisms of adaptation to the environment and minor variations within species.  <br /> <br />6) since God is the creator of life, the probability of a single cell emerging by chance should be virtually zero, and we should not expect life to be generated by non-life by random processes.  <br /> <br />7)since God made the species (a term that does not correspond to the biological concept of species) with special designs, we should dismiss the existence of vestigial organs and junk-DNA.  <br /> <br />8) since God has cursed His creation because of Man's sin, we should expect that along with evidence of design the universe reveals evidence of that curse (v.g. death; carnivory; harmful mutations; accumulation of genetic diseases; death of the unfit; attack and defence systems; poisons; pathogenics).  <br /> <br />9) since there was a global flood several thousand years ago, we should expect to find lots of liquid water in the Planet along with many signs of fossilization and cathastrophism in geology. We should also expect to find many more living fossils than intermediate fossils.  <br /> <br />10) since there was a global flood, we should expect some of its most probable results, including the petrified forests, canions, sediments, fossils, the Ice Age and the continental drift. We also should expect earthquakes, storms, and tsunamis.  <br /> <br />11) since the Earth is young, we should expect that its magnetic field is also still young.  <br /> <br/>12) since the Sun is young we should expect its nucleus to be young.  <br /> <br />13) since the Universe is young we should expect to find mature galaxies even where scientists say they should not exist.  <br /> <br />14) since Man didn't evolve, men will always be men (v.g. Neandertals) and apes will always be apes (v.g. Australopithecus).  <br /> <br />15)since Dinosaurs were living until several millenia ago, we should expect to find many accounts of the interaction between men and \\"dragons\\", and should expect to find soft tissue, ligaments, cells and hemoglobin inside some of their petrified bones.  <br /> <br />16) If a God of Love and Justice has created Man in His image, and if Man has sinned and ruined His creation, than we should be able to look into History and find a special revelation or a dramatic event in which God provides some kind solution to man's problem. Maybe Christmas and Easter can provide some indication.  <br /> <br />The scandal for evolutionists, is that all these and other biblical predictions, although not scientific according to modern scientific standards, have been shown to be true.  <br /> <br />The result is that the scientific community finds itself many times in a state of shock and awe, or of surprise and wonder, when its own predictions are denied time and time again and when creationists predictions are found to be in full accord with observable evidence. The problem, then, lies in the modern scientific paradigm, as well as in the modern dichotomy of science and religion.  <br /> <br />I know that this may be hard to admit for many evolutionists, such as Michael Ruse, that have been indoctrinated by modern rationalists and simply cannot do better than that. Their naturalistic, uniformitarian and evolutionary \\"memes\\", with all their appearance of intellectual sophistication, simply don't allow them to move beyond that.  <br /> <br />The current scientific paradigm may be very appropriate when dealing with observable facts (and there is no conflict between creationists and evolutionists when it comes to observed facts), but it fails miserably when it comes to engaging in origins science. Here we simply cannot do without the Creator and His revelation. Since He is the Alpha and Omega, only He can give meaning to our present existence and provide a reliable account of what happened in the past and of what will happen in the future.  <br /> <br />That's why I find Michael Ruse's position incredibly puerile and naive. If he wants to keep the modern scientific method at the expense of truth, then let him have it. It is his problem. I would prefer to be called a child of God, than a child of modernity. By the way, God is not pre-modern or post-modern either.  <br /> <br />If evolutionists stick to their failed paradigm, against all empirical reasons, they will find themselves, time and again, in a state of shock and awe, surprise and wonder, because evolution simply didn't happen and will never fit the observable data. Evolutionists try to assure us that everything is random and purposeless, and than ask us to take seriously their own thoughts.  <br /> <br />Michael Ruse should study American Constitutional Law and realize that the original meaning of separation of Church and State, in First Amendment to the federal Constitution of 1787, has nothing to do with preventing a scientific recognition of the Creator, based on sound facts and arguments.  <br /> <br />In the American Declaration of Independence of 1776, even fundamental rights are the product of intelligent design, since their fundamental character rests on their being endowed by the Creator. Michael Ruse's \\"constitutional Law\\" arguments could have worked in Jacobin France or communist Soviet Union or Albania, but they should not be allowed to work in America, nor in any decent country.  <br /> <br />Separation of Church and State wants to prevent authoritarian enforcement of religion, \\"science\\" or ideology, but not to prevent the free and open discussion thereof. Michael Ruse naturalistic stakes in this debate distort his vision of religion, science, philosophy and even constitutional law.  <br />"	2005-08-31

An artist who's lost faith in his own abilities, Blake has turned his passion to collecting art.<br /><br />What happens when these two passionate people meet?  An instant meeting of the souls.  All this before they even know each other's identities!  Once Cerise finds out who Blake really is, she is wary but soon agrees to join him in uncovering the truth.  As the pair seek to recreate the events surrounding Maddie's death, danger begins to stalk them.<br /><br />Jo-Ann Power has created an unforgettable story which perfectly blends mystery, romance and history, giving ALLURE a Gothic-like feel.  The book is saturated with visual images:  Queen Victoria's Debut Drawing Room -- described so vividly, a reader almost feels like she's next to make that curtsy; the description of marble statues are so evocative one feels like they've actually touched it.  The book is also peppered throughout with names and anecdotes of the brilliant artists of the age, breathing new life into these historical figures.  At the heart of the matter, however, it is the interaction between Cerise and Blake that is the most poignant.  Both are emotionally injured, and in each other, find comfort and redemption.

Written by a scholar influenced by Britain's current disbelief against historical migrations, Renfrew argues that common linguistic elements spread through the ancient world not through the sudden invasion of a single people, but through the peaceful spread of agriculture out of Anatolia.<br /><br />On one hand, it is nice to see a challenge to Marija Gimbutas theory, which got increasingly weird the longer she articulated it, that the Indo-Europeans were bloodthirsty patriarchal invaders who swept into matiarchal and peaceful old Europe introducing war.  Renfrew, however, goes to far in the opposite direction and the work has serious problems, many of which are common to the works of Renfrew's school. The author has no problem speaking of the occupation of the Carpathian basin by the Magyars, and presumably he believes in recent Turkic migrations, but he refuses to accept migrations in pre-historical times. One of his three points against an South Russian origin is simply \\"It is a migrationist view.\\" The Indo-Europeans are a people uniquely identified with horsemanship--look at the popularity horses in Greek and Germanic onomastics, and the words for \\"axle\\", \\"yoke\\", and \\"horse\\" itself are common to nearly all branches, so moving over long distances would certainly be within their reach. Yet, Renfrew asserts that there is no evidence that horsemanship was important to ancient speakers of IE languages.<br /><br />Renfrew is also not a very committed historical linguist. His presentation of family trees is overly simplistic, with flat-out inaccuracies such as saying that German is descended from Gothic and all of the Slavonic languages from Old Church Slavonic. He seems to be quoting mostly from introductory handbooks of comparative IE linguistics instead of speaking from deep personal familiarity. The only authorities I would really trust to present this material are either amazing polymaths who are simultaneously excellent archaeologists and linguists, or archaeologist-linguist collaborations.<br /><br />If you are interested in the fascinating question of IE origins and the various solutions which have been proposed, I'd recommend J.P. Mallory's IN SEARCH OF THE INDO-EUROPEANS, which is not perfect but does a good job of showing many viewpoints.The only authorities I would really trust to present this material are either amazing polymaths who are simultaneously excellent archaeologists and linguists, or archaeologist-linguist collaborations. <br /> <br />If you are interested in the fascinating question of IE origins and the various solutions which have been proposed, I'd recommend J.P.

Starting with his version of the history of computers (including a hilarious review of MS DOS abort messages) through the process of buying the computer (laptops being the ones with lots of power that are incredibly easy to steal) and beyond, Barry lampoons every conceivable glitch, design error and foolishness associated with computers. He surveys anagram generators, technical non-support, the insane panoply of fonts in word processors, inane chat room conversation, emoticons and the perils of cybersex, He introduces us to a few of the more insane web sites, like \\"Mr, T ate my balls\\", \\"Cursing in Swedish,\\" and \\"The Exploding Whale.\\" Everywhere he looks, it's low-hanging comedic fruit, ripe for the picking.<br /><br />The real joke is that most of us see all of this as normal.

Billy Baddass, Mule, and Meadows, all older and wiser, take yet another journey, this time to deliver the body of Meadows son, killed in Iraq.<br /><br />It's been thirty-five years since Billy Baddass, Mule and Meadows have seen eachother.  Billy has gone on to own a Bar and Grille, Mule has become the pastor of a church, and Meadows, after serving eight years for stealing from the PX, is now working at the PX.  When Meadow's son is killed in the war in Iraq he goes to seek out his old friends who accompany him on his journey to bury his son.<br /><br />Last Flag Flying is a poignant, humorous and action filled story that pulls no punches regarding the war in Iraq, President Bush, and everything else under the sun that is a part of our present culture.<br /><br />Billy Baddass hasn't changed a bit, still the drunk and when the phrase, talking with a sailor's mouth was coined, it must have been because of Billy.  Mule, once an equal to Billy, is now the complete opposite. Meadows is still the naïve kid at fifty-two, but with all the life experiences Billy and Mule have between them, none can equal the experience of losing a child in a war that is this generations Vietnam.<br /><br />What is destined to become a classic and sure to spark debate among all political parties, Last Flag Flying is a story about sacrifice, love and friendship, that will surely make a massive dent into our subconscious.  One of the best books I've read in a long time.	2005-08-31

"For decades, high school and college students were fed a biased rendition of American History. Thomas Woods, history graduate from Harvard, has released this book to serve as a counterpoise.<br /><br />The Politically Incorrect Guide is a revealing read. It focuses on those aspects of American History best known to its casual students. Woods starts with the colonial origins of American Liberty, proceeding to the Constitution. Continuing on the Civil War, the World Wars and the Depression, he thereafter gives a cursory glance at the JFK, LBJ, administrations, before finishing off the last century, and the book, with the Clinton era.<br /><br />This guide is written in textbook format; even the arguments given could easily be understood by a tenth grade student. Wood shatters established myths while managing to elevate some arcane topics and persons to relevance. In this regard I enjoyed his exposition on the oft unmentioned Nullification, Dred Scott, the McCarthy hearings, and nonpersons Walter Duranty, Michael Milken. He also exposes the nexus between history and economics, as well as the winner's predilection with rewriting history.<br /><br />Still this book is hardly a model of scholastic perfection.<br /><br />Woods takes some glib, even facile, explanations as alternatives to what we have been taught. An instance is when he claims \\"slave states would have had more power in the federal government,\\" if blacks had been counted as five fifths of a free man. In a real democracy, power among states is never equal, and should never be. Therefore whether blacks were believed to be five fifths or three fifths of a white is irrevelant; it was an immoral law which was not made right simply because it was approved by our Founding Fathers. (Imagine counting the exploding hispanic population in California as a fraction to curb its national influence.) This treatment of the period after independence as political Utopia suffuses his book. While unabashedly supporting the second amendment, he fails to define what the founders meant by \\"arms.\\" If James Madison resurrected today, would he believe the citizens right to own bazookas and Apache helicopters is enshrined in the constitution.<br /><br />His us-against-them (Libertarian vs. Progressive vs. Conservative) mentality does not permit him at times to see nuances, hence when he chides Lincoln as a racist on the basis of a debate with Stephen Douglas, he neglects stating that slavery was ingrained in the societal fabric, making it difficult for one to declare what he truly believed. I neither blame Lincoln nor Douglas, and would expect likewise from the author.<br /><br />Regardless of its inherent flaws, this book is based on excellent scholarship, aiming less to educate than to challenge. The Politically Incorrect Guide should be read as a reference rather than a stand-alone. It is more useful for asking questions than seeking answers.s to define what the founders meant by \\"arms.\\" If James Madison resurrected today, would he believe the citizens right to own bazookas and Apache helicopters is enshrined in the constitution. <br />His us-against-them (Libertarian vs. Progressive vs. Conservative) mentality does not permit him at times to see nuances, hence when he chides Lincoln as a racist on the basis of a debate with Stephen Douglas, he neglects stating that slavery was ingrained in the societal fabric, making it difficult for one to declare what he truly believed.

Fending fatigue after pulling a double shift, Dr. Phillip Cardoneaux is more than happy to bid his farewell and go home.  While preparing to leave, he is asked by one of the emergency room physicians to help with a patient because they are shorthanded.  The patient is none other than Lily and once he lays eyes on her, Phillip is unprepared for the sudden feelings that come over him.<br /><br />Once his diagnosis is complete, Phillip determines all Lily needs is rest.  So, against her wishes, he confines her to the hospital for one week and, after that at least three more away from work.  Knowing full well that Lily will not follow his directive, Phillip decides to invite her to come home with him to Magnolia Grove to recuperate.  With Lily under his roof, will Phillip be able to refrain from making their relationship one other than that of doctor and patient?<br /><br />BEYOND RAPTURE is the sequel to Beverly Clark's previous novel \\"A Twist of Fate.\\"  In this enticing tale of romance, readers are given a more detailed glimpse into the life of the devastatingly handsome Dr. Phillip Cardoneaux.

"As someone who married (another American) in Firenze (Florence) and has toured Tuscany many times - Dario Castagno has done a lovely job of looking at a year in the life of a Tuscan tour guide.<br /><br />His descriptions of his tourists are very amusing and, sorry to tell the previous (very up-tight) reviewers, ACCURATE!  As an American who lives and works overseas - the Americans that Dario describes - the 'normal' ones, the 'ghosts', the \\"culture vultures' and the 'babs' (oh! the \\"babs\\", I laughed until I cried!) are incredibly spot on.  And these categories of American tourists are EVERYWHERE - not just in Italy!<br /><br />More importantly, Castagno does a wonderful job of weaving the descriptions of the Tuscan countryside and activity during the course of a year.  He skillfully expresses the joys and riches of the Tuscan foods and drinks.  (And any tourist who spends two weeks in Tuscany drinking diet coke should have stayed at home)  He also gives the reader one of the best primers on the Palio that I have ever read (and Robert Rodi's little window into Dario's Palio world in the penultimate chapter is sweet!).<br /><br />This is a book primarily for the Americans in Dario's 'normal' category - who don't take themselves too seriously, who have been to Tuscany and enjoyed its food, wines, art, history, and gorgeous countrysides, and who have met some of those other (embarrassingly \\"American\\") Americans - all over the world and can appreciate Dario's amusement and sometime (warranted) frustrations.<br /><br />A wonderful book, I have already recommended it to everyone I know who has been to Tuscany or who is going.  I wonder if Dario now has way more business than he could possibly handle or need!!"	2005-08-31

This is the fourth and maybe the last book in the trilogy. It started with Startide Rising.  If you want the whole story you have to read that one first.  Heaven's Reach is a vast complex story that could possibly be the end of the Uplift series.  I have heard that Mr. Brin is going to keep writing Uplift stories but he could end it on this one if he wanted to.  This is the best book in the whole trilogy.  It has action, intrigue, chase scenes, LOTS and LOTS of aliens, and more philosophy than you can shake a stick at.  When I finished it I went back and read Startide Rising again after many years, and saw how much Mr. Brin has grown.  He is much better at building a picture in your head. He is better at character development without spending pages on a characters personal history.  He has learned how to write a page turner.  I recommend this and the other three books in this trilogy.	2005-08-31

The Confederates and Unionists are about to have a major battle engagement only a mile from Mrs. McGavick's house, and Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest has commandeered her home as a field hospital.<br /><br />Mrs. McGavick - later to become known as THE WIDOW OF THE SOUTH - is in mourning over the death of three of her children during a typhoid epidemic. And she spends most of her time in bed letting Mariah, a Creole slave, run the household. But the days of mourning her children come to an abrupt end as she must come to grips with the death of 9,000 soldiers in a single day, and care for the wounded whom blanket every square inch of her floors.<br /><br />One of the injured is a tough and vocal man named Zachariah Cashwell, a Confederate nobody. During the day's bloodshed, Mr. Cashwell did an incredibly brave, heroic, stupid, and suicidal thing: After the color-bearer is killed, he picks up the flag and marches toward the enemy as they shoot at him. But he doesn't receive a scratch. Only after being captured and attempting to escape is he given a near mortal wound from a gunshot. Then he's taken to Mrs. McGavick's field hospital to recover or die. Here the two (McGavick and Cashwell) meet and clash ...and eventually fall in love, even after Mr. Cashwell's leg is amputated. Even though Carrie McGavick is married.<br /><br />What follows is a denying of love, a race to save the graves of those who are buried outside of the McGavick home, and a woman who discovers her purpose in life: to honor the memory of those \\"boys\\" who died that day.<br /><br />*****************************************************************************<br /><br />This is Mr. Hicks' first novel and, luckily, he's chosen to write a historical fiction story. He must have poured over tons of information and had great difficulty deciding what to place in the book and what not to. Thankfully, he's chosen to write about the actual battle. And his prose during these scenes is topnotch; he can describe bloodshed and waste and near insanity and giving up and hanging on, in one graceful paragraph.<br /><br />Where Mr. Hicks has fallen down is plotting. Although this story sheds light on a little known Civil War battle that incurred horrendous losses, it didn't seem to have a point. The love story between Mr. Cashwell and Mrs. McGavick (which takes up a large portion of the book) is never explored or explained. Why did they fall in love in the first place? We don't know.<br /><br />The story seemed to meander between the battle, the hospital, Mrs. McGavick, Mr. Cashwell, General Forrest, and two other lovers whom we only see fleetingly.

However, the pleasures of Queen Elizabeth's court have grown pallid compared to the challenges of overseeing his brother's estates during his masquerade. In an attempt to end his ennui, Alex and his best friend Edmund Blackwell wager that each will be the first to steal a kiss from a virtuous lady of the other's choosing. Edmund chooses the Lady Blythe Prescott, a daughter of the Marquess of Kent. What the rogue didn't count on, however, was Blythe's older sister, Emmeline.<br /><br />Lady Emmeline Prescott has resigned herself to never marrying nor raising a family. Now, she is determined that her sister marry her perfect match. Sir Alex Thornton is definitely NOT Blythe's perfect match. He is too experienced, too scandalous and too handsome for his own good. Sir Alex is trouble and Emmeline is going to prove it, even if she has to follow him everywhere. From tavern carousing to bear baiting dens, the rake finds himself shadowed by the determined spinster. Soon, Alex finds himself obsessed with Emmeline rather than Blythe, and Emmeline finds herself with a chance for happiness after all. Will she dare to risk all to get it?<br /><br />With HIS SCANDAL, Gayle Callen continues the story of the Thornton brothers which began with HIS BETROTHED. This diverting tale is a classic battle of the sexes made all the more interesting by Alex's flashes of vulnerability and Emmeline's blossoming spirit. The story moves along at a brisk pace with additional storylines that set the stage for the final story in this trilogy. With its vivid portrayal of Elizabethan life and the simmering sensuality of its main characters, HIS SCANDAL is a tale to savor.<br /><br />TheSchemer	2005-08-31

I'm not sure just why but the story of the women who were shipped from England for crimes to Australia in 1790, seem to really have gotten inside of me.  Sian Rees did an admirable job of fleshing the lives of these women before and after their boat ride.  She did this with scraps of information pulled together form many different sources, and with out becoming judgmental.  You will find this to be an easy book to read, and it will leave with the need to find out more not just about the transport of convict to New South Wales, but also the earlier transports to the Americas.  By the way despite the title of this book, you will be reading about very little sex.  I also should warn you to watch out for the deep love shown and expressed by one of the seaman, for one of the convicts, it is better than any romance novel you'll ever read."	2005-08-31

Although poems like \\"Death in the Family\\" concern death rituals in the rural South, they strike familiar chords in country dwellers everywhere.  Autry's poetry is about people, specific people, many of whose characteristics are familiar to us all.  And his use of imagery brings them to life, at the same time using them to portray the ways in which  human cultures work.  At Miss Anne's funeral, \\"Ladies come with sad faces/and baskets of sweets/teacakes, pecan pies, puddings, memories. . . .\\" and the little girls watch their mothers tending to the chores and duties of death and learn. <br />    The poetry is not without humor, however.  \\"Genealogy\\" reminds us of the way in which people who have known their neighbors well for generations attribute certain characteristics to each family: \\"The Whitsells are a little crazy/but they don't beat up nobody outside the family.\\" <br />    There are also comparisons between life in a difficult but simpler time and life today.  \\"Smells of Life on a Greyhound Bus During World War II\\" asks whether the aroma of a smoky ham on that bus would conjure up the same longings for home and family on a Boeing 727 \\"or would that man made unhuman air/blow it all away?\\" <br />    This book is a rewarding read, and I return to it again and again to recover my humanity after days of automatic checkouts, computer calls with canned messages, and the indignity of airport security checks. <br /> <br />"	2005-08-31

Then there is On the Boardwalk, a 12 oz., oversized 2-toned, porkpie hat that would defintely get you mocked and pointed at in any neighborhood. Another goofy hat is Fun City, a long stocking cap more suitable for a child than a grown woman. Tennessee Hills, a floppy brimmed number, needed the addition of a plaid bow to hide it's hideousness.

She had only the clothes on her back and minimal money in her pocket, but none of that mattered if she could save the baby. She has made a new life for herself and her baby, Sarah, in Montana. She couldn't be happier in her life until the day he tracks her down...<br /><br />David Mitchell is the father of little Sarah, who has spent a long time trying to track down the woman who ran off with his daughter. He and his wife had been unable to have children, so when Lexie agreed to be a surrogate mother, he thought all his dreams were coming true... until she vanished.<br /><br />When David arrives in Mill Creek, Montana, Lexie is terrified. She is certain he is going to take Sarah away, and there is nothing she can do about it, after all she isn't even her mother. What she wasn't counting on was a resurgence of emotions she had thought long-buried. When David makes her a proposal that may solve all their problems, she has to decide, give up on the dreams she's long carried or hold on to them and see what happens. What she doesn't know is that David may very well hold that dream in the palm of his hand, and the heart of a little girl.<br /><br />Ms. Gable once again proves she is a master at touching her readers' hearts with her books. Lexie is torn between what is right for Sarah and what is right for her and David. She has always cared deeply for him, holding on to hopes she is almost afraid to admit to. When they meet up again, David is upset that he has lost so much time with Sarah, missing milestone events for which he was supposed to be there. But in spite of his feelings, he realizes he can't bring himself to hurt Lexie by taking away the daughter of her heart, if not her blood. Long denied and unknown feelings rise to the surface, culminating in a love they have never known... with each other.<br /><br />As always, the reader's heart will be invested in the outcome of the story. One will get misty-eyed along with David when he realizes he has won the love of his beautiful daughter. Lexie's agony over the chance of losing her whole world becomes the reader's own. All of the characters in the tale, all of the townsfolk of Lexie's adopted home, will make their world a real one. Who can not be drawn into the lives of these loving people? This reviewer was so enraptured, she almost expected to turn around and see them walking down the sidewalk.<br /><br />Additionally, she shows no fear at tackling very sensitive issues. In this book she touches on more then one, surrogate parents, mental illness, and laser treatments for children (Sarah has a large birthmark on her cheek.). Surrogate parenthood has often been a hot topic... who does have rights when the child is in danger? As for the laser treatments to improve Sarah's face... when is it OK to take such risks? Each of these subjects is covered fully in this book, making the reader understand the choices made.<br /><br />Simply put, if readers want a moving story that will suck them in and not let go, making them feel strong emotions, Whose Child? is guaranteed to fit the bill.<br /><br />© Kelley A.

It catalogs several hundred buildings and a few other structures, organized by adminstrative regions.  Entries give the architect, location, year completed, as well as some commentary about its design, significance, and at least one picture or plan.  It's not a treatise, but it is a broad overview and a beginning step from which enthusiasts can start their own inquiries into specific works or regions.   <br /> <br />French architecture is concentrated heavily around Paris, so this book must also be, but the author has made a successful effort to balance his work by highlighting notable buildings from all parts of France (as well as from Corsica and overseas territories).

Not only is the writing and character development mediocre at its best, but the author also seems to be perpetuating stereotypes that I do not believe VC Andrews would have approved of. Here is a list:  <br /> <br />Stereotypes:  <br /> <br />1. Because Raine is half white she finds the idea of sex frightening. (This is to  <br />present the image that white women have a higher sense of morality than their African American counterparts.) Where as her sister is hot in the pants. <br />     <br />2. That people who are poor and black can't have healthy relationships.( Her  <br />       mother and her sister.)  <br /> <br />3. That Raine is prettier and smarter than her sister. Since she is the only    <br />      character that is half white, or smart, than one must assume that  it is her  <br />      \\"semi-whiteness\\" that makes her so.  <br /> <br />4. That the projects are some war zone, that only people who are pulled out of it  <br />      can escape.

Knowing the tide will soon come in, she awakens the man only to have him mistake her for a prostitute looking for payment!<br /><br />Their dubious first meeting sets the stage for the rest of the story.

I stumbled upon it. After buying it I opened several other  new books on the topic first because this title does little to excite one's interest. Perhaps \\"Paradigm-shifting insights\\" should be the subtitle. <br /> <br />The authors put their years of research (many scholarly articles and books of their own and references to leading works in the subject) and their experience teaching and drawing into a most satisfyingly wide-angle perspective on teaching and learning to draw.  Step back and look at drawing across cultures, across developmental stages, across the curriculum. What other text attempts to analyze why we draw, why we stop drawing at a young age, what use drawing is in the public schools, and what teachers (not just art teachers) can do to progress. And I find their answers to these questions broad-minded and meshing very well with my own while expanding my perspective on the subject.  <br /> <br />If you like a good analysis of ephemeral subject matter here are some categories presented in this book that will suit you: Reasons drawing should be taught in schools; Two kinds of art; five factors that determine drawing development; the intrinsic biases of simplicity and non-differentiation that learners bring to drawing (my favorite!); the components of the drawing program; and questions most asked about the teaching of drawing. <br /> <br />"	2005-08-31

The writing style is such that one could have little to no background knowledge on the life and campaigns of Napoleon, but by the end of the book, have a knowledgeable outlook on the subject.  This book is unique in how it does not concentrate on only one area in its description. One may read a great description of Napoleon himself, and a few lines later about the French Society at that time period. One of the highlights of the book for me was the description of The Battle of Waterloo. This book is written in a way that one can envision oneself in the shoes of the common foot soldier, as well as Napoleon himself. I could see myself in the midst of the hurling iron and shell that was passed back and forth between Napoleon's forces and the allies. Napoleon's emotions of first anger and then sorrow can be clearly seen through Coote's writing. In my opinion, the description of Waterloo is one of the best descriptions I have read on the subject of Napoleon. After the book is finished, one feels a sense of assurance that an accurate historical understanding of Napoleon has been obtained.  Napoleon and the Hundred Days will go down in my book list, as one of the best novels written on Napoleon and his great campaigns.	2005-08-31

Or so believed Oscar Wilde, perhaps the foremost member of the Aestheticism movement of the late nineteenth century.  Wilde and his followers believed in art for art's sake:  he thought his works needed no meaning beyond beauty.  The Picture of Dorian Gray achieves some level of philosophical meaning nevertheless, but whether the book is worthy of the label 'genius' is questionable.<br /><br />This novel tells the story of Dorian Gray, a vain young man with a powerful personality.  At the beginning of the novel Dorian has a portrait painted by the artist Basil Hallward, and Basil decides never to publish the painting because he put too much of himself into it.  Dorian keeps the painting, wishing that its image would grow old while he himself stayed young.  Eventually his wish comes true, and his increasingly Epicurean lifestyle causes the painting to rapidly age and grow uglier while Dorian himself stays young and beautiful.<br /><br />Despite its authors claims about art, the novel provides considerable insight into human behavior and the depths of apathy and vanity a man can reach.  It is at times horrifying, but at others the writing itself can seem vain.  Wilde often seems more concerned with flattering himself through his writing than with producing anything valuable which, of course, is consistent with his aesthetic philosophy, but that hardly benefits the reader, and I at least disagree with Wilde and believe that a work of art with no real value should not be considered art.  Strewn throughout the novel are quotable passages which give the impression of intellectual depth but at closer inspection seem to contain little more than vanity:  \\"I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world.\\"  \\"Is insincerity such a terrible thing?  I think not.  It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.\\"<br /><br />I did enjoy the novel overall and found it insightful, but I think Wilde's writing is generally too selfish, which is a natural result of his philosophy:  the core issue is that I disagree with his philosophy and am therefore bound to find at least some fault with the art it produces.t insightful, but I think Wilde's writing is generally too selfish, which is a natural result of his philosophy:  the core issue is that I disagree with his philosophy and am therefore bound to find at least some fault with the art it produces."	2005-08-31

"There is little question, it seems to me, that most Americans living in this new century of ours are suffering from a condition one might refer to as the \\"stressed-out\\" syndrome. (And the really unfortunate thing is that this is true of young people as well, some of them barely into their teenage years.) Many of us are working harder, trying to raise families while advancing a career, competing obsessively in the marketplace for that promotion, striving to keep up with the Jones next door, hoping that the pay check will last until the end of the month, and, well, you get the point. Are we simply condemned to this malady by the realities of modern life, or is there a way of successfully meeting this challenge and conquering it? Dr. Kathleen Hall, the author of this book and one of our nation's leading authorities on stress management, thinks there is and she calls it \\"living an intentional life.\\" <br /> <br />This is a self-help book, to be sure. Many of you probably think as I do: most self-help books are so full of psycho-babble, unrealistic expectations, impractical advice, dogmatic prescriptions, and are so far out of touch with the actual world in which most of us live, that they seem to be written only to make some quick money for the author. I assure you this is not the case with Dr. Hall's book. Believe me, I look hard for incidences of psycho-babble in self-help books (it's one of my pet peeves) and I could not find a single case of it here. In sum, she has outlined a simple, easy-to-read, very practical and, above all, undogmatic, blueprint for living an intentional life. <br /> <br />The \\"intentional\\" life, Dr. Hall says, has three simple ingredients: awareness, choice, and energy. These are not sequential; it is simply necessary to \\"become aware of these three key elements in your life and learn how to navigate them.\\" She emphasizes that we ought to look at our daily experiences, listen to what our body and mind are telling us, and become more conscious of how we are living our lives and how we want to live them. If I could put this general prescription into my own words, I would say she is proposing living a \\"proactive\\" life as opposed to a \\"reactive\\" life, and most people do seem to mostly \\"react\\" to the situations they encounter in life rather than make a proactive choice. <br /> <br />There is absolutely nothing complex about the prescriptions in this book regarding how to live an intentional life. Above all, they are very down-to-earth; very much a matter of applied \\"common sense.\\" It is simply that so many people, if not the majority in today's hectic world, either \\"forget\\" to pay attention to these simple ideas or are stressed out and distracted by the events surrounding them. The author here is really recommending that we all need, now and then, to \\"stop and smell the roses,\\" so to speak. <br /> <br />But, of course, there is much more than that presented. She gets down to the \\"nitty-gritty,\\" shall we say, and, chapter by chapter, discusses everything from making your morning shower an event for setting the stage for your day, suggesting gardening (even though you may have to plant a \\"mini-garden\\" in your bathroom) as a means of reclaiming your roots to the soil, altering your dinner experience at home so you have \\"dined well,\\" and, yes, even how to turn dishwashing into a unique and fulfilling experience. To point out the range of \\"ordinary\\" daily experiences she discusses, just let me say that Chapter One is entitled \\"Waking Up\\" and Chapter Twenty-four is entitled \\"Sleeping.\\" Between those two points of reference are chapters devoted to most of the other daily activities we perform and encounters we experience (breakfast, commuting, working, leisure, family, etc.). Furthermore, most chapters end with a suggestion as to how to \\"alter your life\\" in the area discussed. <br /> <br />What I like most about Dr. Hall's book is that it is sound, pragmatic, and undogmatic. It deals with the simple pleasures we canexperience in our lives, if only we would pay attention to them rather than ignore them or get distracted by other things which contribute to our \\"stressed-out\\" syndrome. Since I am by education, inclination, and choice, a philosopher in the formal sense (and an Aristotelian realist, at that!), let me conclude with a more philosophical observation. <br /> <br />Aristotle's famous work, the \\"Nicomachean Ethics,\\" was written to provide us with a blueprint for living \\"a life worth living.\\" His book is, in my opinion and in the opinion of many others, the only sound, pragmatic, and undogmatic work in moral philosophy within the Western tradition of intellectual thought. I have used those same words (sound, pragmatic, undogmatic) to describe Dr. Hall's \\"Alter Your Life.\\" I think this is justified. Furthermore, I suspect that Aristotle, if he were living today, would also approve of her work; he was, after all, that most practical and commonsensical of philosophers. His \\"Ethics\\" was a manual on how to put together a \\"good life\\" through the practice of the virtues; hers is a manual on how to deal with the stresses of this contemporary world or, if you will, how to live a \\"good life\\" through the practice of intentional living in spite of the stresses surrounding us. I think Aristotle and Dr. Hall would have gotten along famously. <br /> <br />I recommend this book and my fellow males should not shy away from reading this book. After all, women on the average live longer than we males do, and it may be (at least partially) because they are willing to seek help and guidance rather than face stressful conditions alone. I know men tend to avoid self-help books because they consider them to be \\"for women.\\" This is unfortunate. Men also need to learn strategies, even the simple ones suggested in this book, in order to live a healthy and meaningful life."	2005-08-31

By developing an intimate relationship with God, similar to that of Abraham, we come to a dimension of understanding, by faith.  Children of God must totally release their lives to Him to allow inexpressible joy and peace to prevail.  Blackaby points out that Abraham is the man God refers to as his friend (James 1:23) and God used his awesome powers to shape Abraham's life not just for a time but for eternity.  By studying the lessons conveyed in CREATED TO BE GOD'S FRIEND, it was Blackaby's intent that the reader would see Abraham's life from God's perspective as well as Abraham's response to God.  Then analyze how these lessons are manifested in our daily lives and help us to see our purpose.<br /><br />CREATED TO BE GOD'S FRIEND is not a book to be taken lightly.  It's lessons are comprehensive and provide further insight into the reader's personal relationship with God.  Each of the thirteen lessons can also be used on a stand-alone basis for personal or group study.

"In early Twentieth century New York, Martin Dressler becomes the quintessential American success story, only to fall on his face in the end.  From humble beginnings, he builds grander and grander hotels, almost suggestive of a more sophisticated version of Disney World.  For instance, in one of his hotels, on a sub-basement floor, the canals of Venice are re-created. <br /> <br />Dressler makes the mistake of assuming that people want to bring the outdoors inside in artificially controlled environments.  His increasingly elaborate visions become more and more bizarre, and display a hubris in building which remind one of Donald Trump.  About half way through, the book takes on an oddly claustrophobic, creepy and surrealistic feel, such as when the author depicts Dressler's marriage to his beautiful, but vacuous and frigid wife, or describes people strolling in the underground artificial worlds created by the main character.  The reader just wants to escape from it all, run outside, and take a breath of fresh air. <br /> <br />Although reading \\"Martin Dressler\\" is an odd experience, the book is somewhat flat with little plot and unmemorable characters.  Nevertheless, I can recommend Steven Millhauser's \\"Martin Dressler,\\" but try to purchase it second hand. <br /> <br />"	2005-08-31

They say the freak in you comes out at night and for Rena Robbins in SWINGERS, this could not be closer to the truth. For most of her life, she has yearned to be with another woman and it began long before her husband Greg stepped into her life.  Greg has been cheating for most, if not all, of their marriage, but when Rena receives a phone call from one of the women he has been sleeping with, she takes a stand.  Though hurt from discovering that Greg is in fact cheating, Rena seizes the opportunity to make her hidden desires come true and she goes all out.  She invites her husband to seek help from a marriage counselor for what she claims will repair their marriage.  The counselor suggests they admire women together.<br /><br />Never in his wildest dreams does Greg imagine the ultimate game being played on him.  Rena is secretly excited because she will have the opportunity to do what she's always desired.  So she gets on the Internet and starts her search to find a female she finds attractive.  Since her willing husband thinks he has a license to cheat, he agrees with her plan and sits back to take the ride. However, in searching for this female, Rena enters into a new place she had not considered and the lifestyle of swinging.<br /><br />In SWINGERS, Torrian Ferguson has given us a peek into a lifestyle that many people have embraced as a way to spice up their sex life.  Even though Rena set out to get her desires met, she really discovers more about her husband and herself in the process.  I like the way this story unfolds and gives the reader some voyeuristic peeks which allow him or her to engage their personal thoughts on the subject of swinging.  A definite page-turner, SWINGERS will keep you entertained until the very end.<br /><br />Reviewed by Nina Lewis<br /><br />for The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2005-08-31

I greatly admire Roy Moore's courage in standing up for his convictions, even in the face of harsh criticism, and even when it meant defying an order he believed was unlawful. Roy Moore is a very educated person, who knows more about American history than most people do.  He also had many admirable accomplishments, even before he became a judge. <br />But some parts of \\"So Help Me God\\" are very tedious and slow to get through.  Also, Roy Moore could use a more humble tone when he writes.  He calls Christians who disagreed with his actions regarding the Ten Commandments display \\"hypocrites.\\"  It's one thing to denounce the actions of anti-God groups like the ACLU, but Roy Moore should treat fellow Christians who have a differing opinion with more respect. <br />But if you want the inside story of what really happened in Alabama a few years ago, this book is worth reading.  <br />"	2005-08-31

Eve or someone close to her dies or nearly dies every month for the last 2 years (of Her life).

Author Jennifer Van Sijll, a screenwriting teacher at San Francisco State with an MFA from USC's Dept. of Cinema-Television, has undertaken a huge task here, compiling dozens upon dozens of examples of how the use of sound, camera motion, angles and picture quality all serve to enhance the magic of cinema. <br /> <br />Chapters cover the gamut from screenwriting and directing technique to the use of space and dimension, frame composition, editing, using the expansion and contraction of time, sound effects, scene transitions (both audio and visual), lighting, use of color, props, camera motion, differing camera lenses, where to position the camera, wardrobe and locations and so much more. In fact, if it isn't included in this virtual encyclopedia of film technique and artistry, it must not exist.   <br /> <br />Each chapter includes plenty of film grabs from the most memorable films in history, from \\"The Graduate\\" to \\"\\"Pulp Fiction\\" to \\"Citizen Kane,\\" as well as photographs that compliment the description and give the reader a more visual sense of the technique's effect. There are also descriptions of the dramatic value achieved with each technique, as well as actual pages from the screenplays that drive the point home. Sijll also includes suggested reading and additional films to view that compliment the elements being discussed, so filmmakers can continue to explore the concepts and techniques outside of the content of this book. <br /> <br />Making films is all about telling a story and that is not just done with words on a page, or even pictures on a screen. There are so many elements involved in the creation of a film, and understanding how to use those elements can truly make the difference between a movie and a masterpiece. For anyone interested in a career in film, \\"Cinematic Storytelling\\" is a priceless guide to creating memories on screen that will last a lifetime and beyond."	2005-08-31

I always hoped, however, that Douglas Adams's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series would at least make the trip enjoyable.  This book however, makes me regret that I held up my thumb in the first place.   <br /> <br />Life, the Universe and Everything deviates greatly from its predecessors in the Hitchhiker's series.  The change was not what bothered me, though.  This book was an enjoyable read, it just lacked the wit and humor that Adams delivered in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and The Restaurant at the End of the Universe.  The storyline was cumbersome and did not flow as well as the previous two installments did.  At the beginning of the book, we find Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect still on prehistoric Earth, until a time portal transported them to a Cricket match, just two days before the destruction of our planet.  From there the plot goes off in hilarious Adams fashion.  Except this time, I feel somewhat empty from it.   <br /> <br />I have two major problems with this story.  The first and most important is that our main characters are rarely together.  I miss the camaraderie that was present in the first book.  There is also very little of the classic British humor that permeated the other books of the series.  Maybe because most of this story was centered around Cricket, and being American I am somewhat ignorant of the game, the jokes weren't as funny for this hitchhiker.  The book did still make me laugh in some places though.  I thoroughly enjoy the Agrajag sub-plot, as it poked fun at previous storylines and contained hilarious inside jokes for readers of the series.  But beyond that, the majority of the story becomes routine, even for Adams.   <br /> <br />I enjoyed the story, but it didn't provide the humor and wit to escape the somewhat discombobulated plot.  Hopefully for this reader, the next time I dare to stick my thumb up to become an intergalactic hitchhiker, the trip won't be as troublesome. <br />	2005-08-31

Life is almost perfect except for her former movie-star mother's obsession with her lack of grandchildren, the lack of men in her daughter's life and the health of her pet albino pig, Miss Sylvie -- and not necessarily in that order.  Another problem is the lack of organization in her storeroom, so when the local contractor sends over his new hired hand, Ali is hopeful that one of her troubles is over.  What she gets is a gorgeous, slightly too thin handyman with empty, haunted eyes.<br /><br />For the past year Matt Baker has been on the run. Moving from one small town to another and doing hard manual labor, all the while hoping to forget what he's left behind, Matt is a man with secrets.  Big ones.<br /><br />Trying desperately to stay emotionally numb, Matt rebuffs Ali's attempts to befriend him.  Soon, however, the magical combination of Saint Maggie's relaxed atmosphere and whimsical residents -- especially a certain chocolate maker -- begins to slowly bring Matt back to life.  An attraction develops between them and one night blazes out of control.  But can their relationship survive when Matt's past catches up with him?<br /><br />In her first mainstream romance, Susan Mallery provides readers with an enchanting feast for the senses.  SWEET SUCCESS is a heartwarming tale of second chances and forgiveness with characters and a setting as rich and evocative as the finest box of chocolates.

Amir's lack of courage and his struggle with it moved me to tears, because it reminded me of people who I know who are just like him: people who are afraid to stick up for the truth because it will hurt themselves.  <br /> <br />I have not read such a captivating book in a long time; a book where the author is not afraid to talk about courage and honor, without making those qualities sound archaic. Apart from the characters themselves, I loved the way Hosseini dealt with the loss of a homeland and its recreation in a new alien land. So many times immigrant authors get stuck in recreating the other, but Hosseini has found a balance between nostalgia and the present, between longing and belonging.  <br /> <br />If you have left people or a place behind you must read this book; maybe Hosseini's prose will rouse the same emotions in you as it did in me.	2005-08-31

From a writing perspective, I thought it was well above average for genre fiction.  It was a page turner to be sure. <br /> <br />What screws this book up, though, is the author succumbing to a cardboard-cutout version of the \\"evil corporation\\", and the rose-colored-glasses liberal idea that the Hadals (the name given to the demon creatures), despite their brutal nature, were just misunderstood people with a glorious history that only ignorant thugs would want to harm. <br /> <br />It has a couple of other minor problems; the narrative skips several years of \\"development\\" in the underworld without much explanation as to why the underworld became commercially exploited so soon after a massive loss of military forces. <br /> <br />And speaking of this massive loss, it kind of begs the question why the military didn't exploit weapons of mass destruction -- either low yield nukes or fuel-air explosives when combatting the hadals?  The pressurve wave (and possibly radiation) created by such weapons would have been extremely effective in a confined space, even if it was as vast as the author describes. <br /> <br />It's a reasonable read, but it kind of leaves you disappointed."	2005-08-31

The book was written in the 1930's and the characters and stories relate people and places in that time, which are timeless stories with practical results in dealing with other people with much wisdom. And some of these characters, as in Theodore Roosevelt, are worth remembering, significant people not to forget. While this is an easy to read this book, it's another thing to both apply and remember to apply in daily situations with other people.<br /><br />How many people really listen to one another, try to remember their names, let them save face, try to let them take credit for ideas, show them importance, smile, relax, empathize, apply Socratic inquiry over correcting, asking questions instead of giving orders, call attention to others mistakes in an indirect manner, admit one's own mistakes, lay down a positive reputation before proof, make light of other's faults seeming easy to correct and so forth.

This is one of the ones with less action than some (The Cuckoo's Egg or The Paladin) but more than others (if I recall correctly, Hellburner and the Fortress series have much longer stretches of introspection.)  Just like Down Below Station, there are perspectives from many different sides of the story - different factions on station, and on the planet. <br /> <br />If you're looking for sword fights, read the Fortress series,  The Paladin (my personal favorite), or The Cuckoo's Egg.  If you're looking for more action, read the Foreigner series.  If you've read them all, and you're looking for another good book from an excellent writer, this should do it for you.	2005-08-31

Highly recommended for grades 3 through adult	This is fantasy the way it should be written, on two planes: one is the story and the other is the adult-engaging sarcasm and humor. This book is a great pleasure to read out loud to your (older) elementary school child, or to read to yourself just for the sheer fun and escapism.<br /><br />There has been, no surprise, a spate of wizarding fantasy, but this book finds a new approach, a new world, and has virtually nothing whatsoever to do with the Harry Potter-inspired approach to wizards.  In this world, England is divided into Wizards (who run the government and have demons who do their bidding) and commoners (muggles), but the commoners are quite aware of (and perhaps a bit resentful of) the magicians. The magicians themselves spend quite a bit of time scheming to increase their power, and the demons spend most of their time angry about their enslavement in service to the magicians petty needs.<br /><br />In the middle of this comes a young, highly talented, perhaps ambitious apprentice with a conscience who uncovers a dastardly plot.  Things do not proceed in a predictable way, and the book is full of unexpected twists and not a few insights into how people with power actually do behave.<br /><br />This first book in the trilogy has a bit of violence, and younger children will miss some of the humor (maybe most of it) but they will be engaged by the characters and they will be enthralled by the story.  I'd be cautious with children under 9, but if they've read HP, they'll be fine here.<br /><br />We are very much looking forward to reading book 2 and can't wait for the release of book 3.	2005-08-31

Finola O'Kane's book is a considerable development in rectifying this. Her book covers several large and two smaller landscapes developed around Dublin in the eighteenth century by wealthy men and women of the largely Protestant Ascendancy. She looks at the economic and horticultural background to the gardens and estates and describes the social, aesthetic and political influences on their designers and owners. The author specifically covers the \\"designing women\\" such as Emily, Duchess of Leinster, and her sister Louisa Connolly, who were so important in the creation of these landscapes. The hydraulics and engineering, the sources of the plants (including new exotics from America) and what drove the designers and for what purpose are very well covered. The separate landscapes and their designers are fascinatingly linked together. The book is lavishly and beautifully illustrated with contemporary and modern pictures, maps, plans and designs. It is extremely well researched  (as evidenced by the extensive footnotes and appendices), with a good index and excellent bibliography. This is a very readable, well-written book, which is also an important contribution, not only to the study of Irish heritage, but to that of Europe generally."	2005-08-31

It is difficult reading, but the format would work well as a reference guide.  I truly glory in the things in this book and I hope it can advance the Christian cause.  I do consider myself a Christian believer, but putting myself on the outside looking in, I can see there is no slam dunk here.  As one can readily see from previous reviews, the physical evidence can be explained away.  There is some very compelling evidence in this book, but the vast majority of the evidence consists of reasoning (though I believe the reasoning for the most part to be sound) with the accounts written from within the Bible itself, or theologians commenting on it.  The most credible accounts are from the Jewish historian, Josephus, though in recent decades even some of his accounts have come into question.  There is reference to some lost Old Testament cities that have been recovered in recent decades.     <br /> <br />I do not base my faith on whether or not there is physical evidence to support it, as it would truly be shaky ground to stand on, especially in this day.  On the other hand, it was Austin Farrar that said, \\"Though argument does not create conviction, lack of it destroys belief. What seems to be proved may not be embraced; but what no one shows the ability to defend is quickly abandoned. Rational argument does not create belief, but it maintains a climate in which belief may flourish.\\"  This book is a wonderful example of just such \\"rational argument\\" that at times is very convincing.   <br /> <br />There is no doubt that there is power in evidence to advance the nurturing of faith.  But this should not overshadow the fact that there is an even greater power to be had beyond physical evidence or reasoning. The Savior Jesus Christ tells us himself of a much greater, even more powerful witness that man can have in Matthew 16, \\"Jesus answered and said unto him,Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-jona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.\\"  I don't think the need for faith will ever be completely diminished in this life. <br />"	2005-08-31

With plenty of intrigue to deepen the plot, the reader will be unable to put this book down, waiting for what comes next.<br /><br />Vergil Duclairc, also called Laclere, likes to have things done his way. Since his older brother, the Viscount, died, he has had to take on much responsibility for his family - a responsibility and title he had never desired. His brother's death changed him, forcing him to become less carefree about his actions. As a result of the now strict code Vergil keeps for himself, he is called \\"the Saint\\" by those close to him.<br /><br />Bianca Kenwood is an American. She has come to England with her companion, Jane, as the ward of Viscount Vergil Duclairc. However, she has no desire to be under the thumb of one such as he... she desires to go to Milan to seek training and fulfill her only dream, to be a professional singer. Her plan is to get Vergil to relinquish his duty as her guardian so she can go to Italy, using money from her inheritance.<br /><br />These two are at odds from the moment they meet. Bianca only wants to be granted her freedom, whereas Vergil has other plans for her... and her inheritance. He is on a mission to find out what drove his brother to take his own life, all the while preserving his family's name and good standing in society. Bianca is only a means to an end for him, until he begins to realize he cares for her more then a guardian should. She chafes at his strict control over her so she is determined to do whatever it takes to get him to release her, though in time she grows to question whether or not she wants to be free of him for good.<br /><br />However, the mystery deepens as Vergil begins to uncover a chain of events in which his brother was just one link, putting his and Bianca's lives in danger. Will he solve the mystery behind his brother's untimely demise? Can Bianca and Vergil overcome their differences to find the passion they both long for?<br /><br />The reader is reintroduced to beloved secondary characters from The Seducer, showing what has become of them in the time lapsing between the two books. Vergil is a changed man, having been through a lot, making him grow up and mature from the romantic he was, to the driven man he has become, the \\"saint.\\" Bianca is refreshingly innocent, or so she seems until one gets to know her better. Who she is truly, is a strong-minded young lady, with the gumption to do something about it. Naive in many ways, she still knows a lot more about life than would be expected of a young lady of the time. From the moment these two meet, with Bianca dressed up in an elaborate opera costume, the sparks fly, which neither one was expecting.<br /><br />The plot is complex as well, unfolding in layers, which only enhance the story. Multiple secrets are entwined, causing Vergil's discreet investigation to take many turns, most of which only increase the risk of danger for his family. When he finds a string of blackmail incidents that all lead to one place, the mystery deepens as the reader, along with Vergil, strives to find the answers. Ms. Hunter skillfully weaves the tale, throwing a couple of wrong turns into the mix, by providing false trails to follow. This reviewer was delighted by the fact she had no idea who the real villain was, until the climactic scene resolving it all, which is quite surprising and not at all what was expected.<br /><br />One will also be happy to visit with previously introduced characters. This book, though part of a series, is a stand-alone. However, this reviewer recommends reading The Seducer first, as it helps one to better know our hero and his friends. It also sets up the rest of the series nicely, providing enough additional information about those featured in the coming books to make the reader want to know more about them. A fast-paced, emotional story, this book comes highly recommended. Go out and get a copy today.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, October 2003. All rights reserved.oday.     © Kelley A.

US	50964929	R2FLX5HNEWZG39	0843953799	803525775	The Barbarian	Books	4	2	2	False	False	Riveting	One of my huge pet peeves in romance books is when a character from a previous book is killed off and the remaining character is given another book to end up with someone else. It's a huge no-no for me, and I always try to stay away from books like that. THE BARBARIAN, for me, was like that. It's the sequel to THE CONQUEROR, and even though Roxanne and Kayan are betrothed when they were kids in the first book, Roxanne is forced to marry another.<br /><br />In THE BARBARIAN, it starts off with Kayan receiving news that Roxanne has been killed, and he vows to avenge her death. What he doesn't know until later is that she was given poison to make her look dead while she was taken to Egypt on the orders of the King. When she comes to, she doesn't know who anyone is, nor her own name, and the King tells her that her name is Mayet and that she's the widow of a good friend.<br /><br />Despite the King already having two wives and various concubines, he wants Roxanne/Mayet as his Queen too.<br /><br />During this time, Kayan is given the news of what really happened to her and decides he's not going to sit back and just do nothing. He's going to find her and bring her back to her home, and finally, make her his wife.<br /><br />Months later, the King and Mayet are surprised by a visit from Kayan and his two sons -- the King, because he doesn't want to lose her and knows it's only a matter of time before she remembers who she is, and Roxanne/Mayet, because when she first meets him, she is stunned to see him glaring at her so furiously. Later that night, she's awakened by images from her past to find the barbarian standing over her. He tells her who she is, and explains who he is, and she doesn't believe him, at first. Not until a confidant confirms his story. From there, it's a race to get as far away from the King as possible, because he's determined to find her and bring her back.<br /><br />When I realized the same woman from THE CONQUEROR was the heroine in this one, I almost put it down without finishing it. I never could, and probably never will, understand why an author takes the time to write about one hero, have the readers enjoy his story, and then kills him off in the next one. And there was another thing that bothered me in the book -- how the hero and heroine didn't even come face to face until much later in the book. But from the moment he snuck into her room and told her who she was, I was sitting on the edge of my seat to see what happened next. I couldn't find it in me to stop reading it, and hated every little interruption that took me away from the story.<br /><br />Although the first few chapters lagged for me, from the moment Kayan and Roxanne saw each other the story and the vivid scenes had me captivated. I look forward to reading the next book in this series.<br /><br />Madn this one, I almost put it down without finishing it.

In person he could be rather abrasive, to the point of being ridiculous, like Ross Hunter in a caftan.  But on the pages of his book, he exhibits a warm, spiritual nature, almost like a priest.  Since the days of the Chekhov dynasty, the director has of course assumed near divine proportions in the theater and you get the feeling Ball enjoyed that role, but he is often very courteous towards his actors.  He even goes so far as to say that \\"one of the director's most important qualifications is knowing when NOT to interrupt his actors.\\"<br /><br />He was a professional director and the book covers every contingency from \\"first reading to opening night.\\"  Some of Ball's advice is not going to help you if you are an amateur.  He gives the advice that actors, like cattle, can't hold too many ideas in their heads at one time so he urges the director to come up with a shorthand of small verbs or nouns with which the actor might make himself aware at all times.  \\"Seduce,\\" for example, might be his direction to the actor playing Cleopatra.  Sounds elementary, but it works!  After all, he was the man who boasted that he discovered Annette Bening.<br /><br />He notes that often, for the first ten minutes of a play, the audience finds itself uncomfortable, with a marked realization of the artificiality of theater.  They are sitting in a dark room and watching a bunch of people all lit up pretending to be real.  As directors our job is to make those first ten minutes fly by so that the dream can swamp the audience and take them along with us on our journey.  In passages like this one, he writes beautifully.  Within a year or two after completing his book he was summarily fired from ACT and not long after that he had left this world for another, behind the curtains of life.

Portland detectives, Ray Barkley and Nina Parker, are faced with a serial murderer that is going against all odds. This killer is wiping out men who have abused and beaten their wives or girlfriends, yet have gotten no punishment in the judicial system. Four men have been brutally slain with baseball bats and the count is rising. The killer beats them until they are unrecognizable. Not only is this criminal smart, the person appears to be a woman, which is a bit outside the profile for serial killers. To further complicate issues, Ray and Nina had an affair in the past and Nina becomes just a touch jealous when Ray falls hard for the judge involved in the case. Meanwhile, the judge's former lover, a defense lawyer who appears frequently in her court, has married and wants the judge to counsel his wife Vivien, on whether or not to have an abortion. The judge, Carole Cranston, is not sure whether to trust the friendliness of the wife or not. Maybe Vivien is the murderer; however, Nina is sure the judge is the guilty party.<br /><br />R. Barri Flowers has created a superb mystery. Every time you think you know who did it, another monkey wrench is tossed into the mix. Some characters seem so guilty but then you find yourself praying that they didn't do it because although they have good reasons for killing, it would just break your heart. There's just enough romance and romantic triangles to keep the interest going.

This is a book that explores \\"what may happen.\\" It almost has a \\"warning\\" sticker at the end and you just want to think about the future after reading it. <br /> <br />(sorry, I suck at explaining plots without stupidity invovled, but I'm going to do it anyways) <br /> <br />This story takes place in the future. Usually in futuristic sci-fi films, we expect guns and blowouts and tons of action, but The House of the Scorpion is very quiet in a way. Once you've finished the book, you feel that emptiness of what you have believed in good and evil. Matt is six years old and he gets discovered by three children who lived in the house over the poppy fields where Matt loved the look upon at and where his caretaker works. A few moments after entering the house, he is thrown out and banished. He finds out he is the clone of a powerful druglord. The original Matteo Alacran (Matt's name) is called El Patron. He is 140-something years old. He is controlling but at the same time you feel sorry for his childhood. You think about him and you get this image and he juts says, \\"Look how far I have come. From poverty to powerful drug lord.\\" You kind of want to understand him but at the same time, you have this strong hate for him. He changes the whole premis of evil. I like books like that. <br /> <br />The book has a nostalgic feeling. Matt seems to have a crush on one of the senator's daughter, Maria, who treats him as some pet of some kind. But Matt's love for Maria never seem to be comfirmed or actually shown throughout. You just know that Matt has feelings for Maria for more then friendship. It shows that his coming-of-age is normal. It's not \\"clone-like\\" or whatever, he's just like everybody else. He can get jealous or think awful thoughts but he is still is humaneven though he is a clone. <br /> <br />Throughout the book, Matt seems to question himself. You can just feel the questions wavering in his mind, \\"Am I normal?\\" \\"Do people like me?\\" I think those are the exact questions a clone might ask if this was the future. <br /> <br />Nancy Farmer is a writer to the perfection. She seems to write children as if they were wandering around as her Lego figures. She makes everything so believable and wonderful and tightly done, you almost forget this is a science-fiction novel. You think the characters are like you, and they have thoughts, emotions, feelings, and a mind. I think the mind is a powerful thing. The mind defines if one should be good or evil. It automatically decides sometimes. Good or evil is a huge part of this book because it asks the question, \\"Can one be good AND evil at the same time?\\" Yes. The answer is absolutely yes. <br /> <br />This book asks so many questions. After reading this book, you think about the world differently. This book is as perfect as can be and is one of most special book I have read in the past few years."	2005-08-31

"This book DOES NOT teach you audio basics such as audio theory. Nor is it aimed at \\"seasoned\\" audiophiles with an interest in recording or \\"Live\\" sound. None of that is in this book. \\"Well, what's it good for\\"? you may ask. While this book is not intended to be a Reference book this book is great if you're a service technician that works on consumer audio equipment. It does a GREAT JOB on giving you troubleshhoting tips and procedures and a little bit of theory on the operation and servicing of CD players, DATs, AM/FM receivers(the audio sections only,not RF) and VHS HI-FI VCR's (Remember those?). <br /> <br />Beyond that, that's about it. If you're into recording or want a more \\"advanced\\" book on audio theory such as the basics of microphone operation, different types of connectors, mixers, or any other \\"professional\\", look for \\"Understanding Audio\\" by Daniel M. Thompson or any other book that concentrates on that subject.  <br /> <br />That said I must also point out that John D.Lenk IS a foremost authority when it comes to troubleshooting and repair and I would advise anyone in the electronics service field to read as many of his books that you can get your hands on.

Competition and jealousy figure prominently in the time line, which covers many years in the lives of a few sad people. You could say Michael Henchard was doomed from the 1st chapter. He certainly is haunted by his past to the point of no escape. And in fact, it's his past (as well as everyone who was part of it) that fuels the inevitable heartbreak to come. Casterbridge as a central location isn't quite as powerfully stark as Edgon Heath from... Native but the landscape does affect the players in similar ways. A wicked sense of folly usually dominates every novel Hardy has written.	2005-08-31

"These blockbusting bestsellers always grab my attention. I like to see for myself what makes people buy them. Sometimes I enjoy them very much - \\"Da Vinci Code\\", the Harry Potter and Dark Tower series, and many more. Sometimes these bestsellers are simply unreadable - I have tried Danielle Steel and Sidney Sheldon, but couldn't finish either. Well, tastes differ in each person.<br /><br />So, I picked up \\"The five people you meet in heaven\\" because it was a very short read, althoguh some of the people I met here on Earth - people that had read this book - told me it was simply wonderful, a blend of Paulo Coelho and Jostein Gaarder. To tell you the truth, Paulo Coelho and Jostein Gaarder are two of the worst authors I've ever come across, but I went on and read Mitch Albom anyway.<br /><br />This book is much better than I expected, but reading it is not the fullfilling, once-in-a-lifetime experience people promised me (of course). Eddie, the main character, is the maintenance chief of a second-rate amusement park. At the beginning of the book, he dies. He goes to heaven. As the title says, he meets five people that were, in different ways, part of his life. Mitch Albom uses these five characters to tell Eddie's life from the beginning, and explain its meaning.<br /><br />Albom's writing is simple and direct, but he doesn't treat his readers like idiots - like Paulo Coelho does. He is not trying to teach you something in a boring way with each sentence - like Jostein Gaarder does. He simply thought of a cute afterlife story, wrote it, and sold millions. Good for him. The story is really cute, but not original. It's never boring, but always plain. And, oh yeah, it is as corny as can be. But, all in all, nice.<br /><br />So, there it is. I have read it. My life has not changed forever. I'm still the same person I used to be. But \\"The five people you meet in heaven\\" is a simple, fast book. Read it. Maybe YOUR life will be changed.<br /><br />Grade 5.8/10r />"	2005-08-31

William Kinderman's essay: \\"The piano music: concertos, sonatas, variations, small forms\\" deals briefly but insightfully with Beethoven's body of work for the piano, focusing on the first three sonatas of opus 2, the \\"Waldstein and Appassionata\\" sonatas from Beethoven's mid-career, and the final three sonatas, opus nos. 109, 110, 111.  John Daverio's essay, \\"Manner, tone, and tendency in Beethoven's chamber music for strings\\" is a difficult study which uses literary and critical theory to show the differences between the quartets of Beethoven's early and middle period on the one hand and the final quartets on the other hand.  Both these essays were challenging and helped me with my listening.<br /><br />But I couldn't stop with the two essays and proceeded to read the entire book, part of a series which presents the best of musical scholarship and thought on the great composers.  This book of studies of Beethoven is edited by John Stanley of the University of Connecticut and consists of 17 essays by 16 scholars (Stanley has two essays) devoted to Beethoven's life and music.  If there is a theme running through this varied collection, it is that each essay tries to put Beethoven in a musical or historical context.<br /><br />The book is divided into four parts.  The first part, \\"A Professional Portrait\\" consists of three essays discussing Beethoven's life, his compositional techniques (the use of sketchbooks), and the traditional division of his works into three periods.  This part of the book includes a detailed and useful chronology of Beethoven's life.<br /><br />The second part of the book, \\"Style and Structure\\" consists of three essays which deal broadly with Beethoven's works and which discuss similarities and differences between Beethoven and Haydn and Mozart.  There is an excellent essay by Roger Kamien on Beethoven's use and development of thematic material which is technical but not beyond the reach of the devoted music lover.<br /><br />The third part of the book, called \\"Genres\\" consists of seven essays which examine each of the major genres in which Beethoven composed.  As I mentioned, the essays on the string quartets and the piano sonatas initially drew me to the book.  The remaining essays cover Beethoven's symphonies, focusing on his imaginative orchestration, the genesis of Beethoven's opera \\"Fidelio\\", the chamber music with piano, including the violin sonatas, cello sonatas, and trios and their development over Beethoven's career, the religious music, and the songs.  I particularly enjoyed this last essay by Amanda Glauert, \\"Beethoven's songs and vocal style\\" which traces Beethoven's songs from their origins in folk music and shows how Beethoven transformed the form.  Beethoven's songs, I think, still are insufficiently appreciated.<br /><br />The final section of the book, \\"Reception\\" consists of four essays which discuss the influence of Beethoven on other composers, different performance practices for Beethoven's music, the various ways in which Beethoven's music and personality have been viewed by the public (an excellent essay by Scott Burnham), and another excellent essay by David Dennis, concluding the book, which discusses Beethoven's influence on the arts, philosophy, and politics.<br /><br />In reading this volume of essays, I was reminded of the great appeal Beethoven has exerted, and continues to exert on many people.  Unlike most other composers of art music, his work has been an inspriation to people of all nationalities, ages, and walks of life from the most learned to the untutored.  His music has the capacity to draw listeners in, to make them involved, and to demand a response.  I got to know Beethoven's music, and something of his life, as a child and his hold upon me has continued.  This book helps to develop and to explain the devotion Beethoven continues to inspire.  As Scott Burnham states at the conclusion of his essay, \\"The Four Ages of Beethoven\\" (p.291)<br /><br />\\"Even now, after a century seemingly intent on annihilating all formerly comforting illusions of greatness and transcendent authority offered by the leading figures in our history, we have not yet managed to put the Beethoven myth behind us. For Beethoven continues to require that we grapple with him, continues to ask much of us, to call us out.  This, more than anything, is why we cannot let him go: his music remains a sounding provocation to what we are pleased to think of as our better selves.\\"<br /><br />This book will be of most immediate interest to those readers who already know Beethoven's music and who have read some of the many excellent basic studies of his life and works, such as the recent biographies by Maynard Solomon, Barry Cooper, and Lewis Lockwood, among others.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanto develop and to explain the devotion Beethoven continues to inspire.

The first three sections give the book its title - vanity (cosmetics, skin products), vitality (food-related topics), and virility (the biochemical functioning of the male reproductive system, as well as some information on Viagra).  The rest of the chapters focus on how to kill germs, brain chemistry, and polymers of various uses.<br /><br />The book goes into more detail than many other \\"popular chemistry\\" books that I've read.  Unfortunately, it doesn't go into more technical detail - the author seems to want to avoid getting too technical, referring the reader instead to a glossary of technical terms.  This is a good idea but poorly carried out.  For example, he discusses oils, fats, and waxes, but no where does he define the difference between them.  Mostly this does not detract from the enjoyment of the book, because chemists are likely to already know the answer and most lay people will not care for a technical explanation anyway.<br /><br />The topics are interesting and varied.  The commentary is mostly neutral: when chemicals are dangerous he points them out, but mostly he emphasises times when \\"chemicals\\" are unfairly maligned.  For example, toxicity tests are usually performed with concentrations far in excess of what a person would encounter in everyday life.  Statistically insignificant correlations are released to the media without qualification.  If nothing else, this book will alert you to keep an eye out for the purpose behind research.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book just doesn't read as well as other \\"Chemistry for the Public\\" books.  There are some weird lapses in the narrative where the author is apparently trying to make a joke, but that is just awkward or mildly offensive.  The Joe Schwarcz books are more interesting and better written, if much less detailed."	2005-08-31

After being taken from her alcoholic mother at a young age, Rachel Taylor is living in the projects being raised by her loving aunt  Mama Belle.  At the age of 14 she has an affair with an older married neighbor, which results in the birth of her daughter Grace.

Yes, he does tie together some important ideas about how civilizations develop, but the author is clear from the start that the purpose of the book is to argue that poverty is not the fault of the impoverished, and wealth isn't a reflection on the merits of the wealthy.  This is a point that he returns to so often that it becomes tiresome.  Any explanation of historical development that actually looks at the qualities of the players involved rather than at their good or bad fortune is dismissed offhandedly.  This is a political commitment that requires him to overplay factors in human development like geography.  The book is worth reading, but largely to show how academic presuppositions can get in the way of good research.	2005-08-31

"For those who want an idea of what the author is up to before deciding to read the book, here's a rough outline of an argument that is *similar* to what Barry Miller offers.  It's rough and ready and merely an attempt to express the argument's gist.  Of course - to state the obvious - to appreciate its true probative force (such as it is), one really needs either to read his book or at least a detailed article written by Miller himself.  After all, he's the best one to know what he's up to - relying exclusively on someone else's summary nearly always evinces the pitfalls involved with second-hand testimony.<br /><br />- The general idea is to find an argument against the claim that Fido's existing is a brute fact, without relying on any *metaphysical* principle of causality or sufficient reason.  Miller thinks he has found one, and it's something like this:<br /><br />(1) Fido is a `constituent' of Fido's existing.  [By `constituent' of a given ontological whole he means those `parts' of said whole that need to be recognized under pain of not knowing what the whole is in itself (as opposed to knowing it simply in relation to something else).  So he's saying that it's impossible to know what Fido's existing is in itself without recognizing two distinct parts, Fido and his existence.]<br /><br />(2) Since Fido is a `constituent' of Fido's existing, Fido must be able to `complete' his existence.  [Miller spends a long time attempting to explain and demonstrate the meaning and truth of his notion of a subject completing one of its property instances.  He also spends a great deal of time arguing that existence can be a property instance.  I won't provide either of those arguments here, but suffice to say that according to Miller property instances are in themselves incomplete entities, i.e. they metaphysically require some other entity.  For a subject to `complete' its property instance is for the subject to individuate and make obtain said property instance (which is in itself nothing but a kind of `pattern' of the ontological whole).]<br /><br />(3) In order to complete one's existence, one must be conceivable irrespective of existing at all.<br /><br />(4) Fido must be conceivable irrespective of existing at all. (2,3)<br /><br />(5) But Fido is absolutely inconceivable prior to his existing. [This premise is the result of another long chapter and appendix of argumentation.]<br /><br />(6) Since (4) and (5) appear to contradict one another (or at least are in some sort of tension -- a tension that most thinkers would want resolved, irrespective of their views on the principle of sufficient reason and such), some explanation is necessary as to how both can be true.  Specifically, it's appropriate to demand that there be something (used widely to include any type of entity) in virtue of which Fido is able to complete his existence irrespective of his existing.<br /><br />(7) Fido does not complete his existence in virtue of his existing, taken as a whole [By definition of `constituent', Fido's existing is completely derivative on its constituent parts.  If Fido's existing accounted for Fido's completing his property instance of existence, then, according to the argument Miller elaborates (not provided here), Fido would no longer be a constituent of his existing, contra (1).]<br /><br />(8) Fido does not complete his existence in virtue of any his property instances, including the property instance of existence.  [The idea here is that, since the subject is logically prior to any of its property instances, none of its property instances are even \\"around\\" to explain anything until logically after the subject has already completed them - which is, of course, too late.]<br /><br />(9) Fido does not complete his existence in virtue of himself qua concrete individual subject.  [This premise, for better or worse, is pretty much exclusively based on the idea that if Fido could complete his existence in virtue of himself qua concrete individual (i.e., abstracting from its existence) Fido ought to have been conceivable even prior to existing.  Though I think Miller is especially weak on this point, the gist of the argument goes something like this:<br /><br />  (a) Ability to complete one's property instances<br /><br />  entails being conceivable irrespective of<br /><br />  existing - from (3).<br /><br />  (b) If Fido completes his property instances<br /><br />  purely in virtue of what he is apart from<br /><br />  existing (namely, in virtue of being a concrete<br /><br />  individual), he ought to have been conceivable<br /><br />  even temporally prior to existing.<br /><br />  (c) But this isn't the case, given (5).]<br /><br />(10) Fido's ability to complete his existence must be in virtue of something else other than himself (abstracting from his existence), his existence or any other property instance (abstracting from Fido), or his existing (taken as a whole).  [From (5), (6), (7) (8)].  Let this `something else' be a.<br /><br />That's the first part of the argument.  Miller then notes that, if a must also complete its existence, the same question will need to be raised about a as was raised about Fido.<br /><br />Predictably, the second part of Miller's work is to argue against the possibility of infinite regress.  (From here on in the argument is familiar in form to the classical contingency model, but the arguments he adduces are somewhat different and certainly more analytic in _expression.)<br /><br />After arguing against infinite regress, Miller speaks about the first thing in the finite chain of explanation (call it m*); he probes what m* must be like to avoid being subject to the same questions as above.  He submits that this can only be if there isn't any such thing as m* having to complete its existence.  From this he concludes that, in some sense (analogous, not univocal), there is no distinction between m* and its property instance of existence, i.e., m* is \\"Subsistent Existence\\" (ala Aquinas).  He then goes on to discuss what the notion of Subsistent Existence entails, its relationship to everything else, etc.<br /><br />Anyway, for whatever its worth, this is this bumbling philosopher's \\"shooting at the hip\\" attempt to explain Miller's argument for God.  Do I think that the argument is ultimately successful?  I'm up in the air.  I suspect that he is on to something (something true), but I'm unable to pin down exactly what that is, and I certainly do have reservations about certain aspects of the argument (e.g. premises 6 and 9).  In any case, he goes further than a lot of contingency theorists in attempting to establish an argument that has probative force and is not as metaphysically committed.  Whether he succeeds in this earnest endeavor is another question.  Nevertheless, for those who enjoy reading arguments for God's existence, I can't imagine why Miller's work would be any exception.idual (i.e., abstracting from its existence) Fido ought to have been conceivable even prior to existing.

"I started with Photoshop 5 and have progressed with each new version since then.  I've accumulated a fair number of books on Photoshop over the years.  Although this deals with only one aspect of PS -- Camera Raw -- it is, by some margin, the most useful book on digital image processing that I've ever purchased.  It explains in detail the many features of Camera Raw 3.X.  And the latest version of this software that ships with PS CS2 is feature rich.  Without a guide like this, you won't know how to take advantage of half the features that are there. <br /> <br />Some complain that there is too much detail.  The book is set up in such a manner that you can take or leave as much detail as you wish.  Don't want to know about XMP in detail, no problem, skip that chapter, but when you might want to learn more about it come back when you have the time and inclination.  But it serves as both a reference that you can pull out when you have a specific question and can be read from cover to cover if you want to know all the nuances of this program.   <br /> <br />Best of all Mr. Fraser's anaylysis of workflow while using Camera Raw is indispensible. He provides many useful tips on using Bridge and Camera Raw together.  For me photography is an avocation.  But I find that I end up with hundreds upon hundreds of photos upon returning from a vacation or even just going out for a day's shooting.  It is easy to spend countless hours in front of the monitor reviewing and processing your RAW images.  Fraser gives you the expert's inside view on how to cut your time down and only do what is necessary.   <br /> <br />If you're not truly \\"into\\" digital photography and don't want to be bothered spending some time getting the absolute best out of your RAW imanges, then this book is not for you.  But if you want to start the process of maximizing the potential of your images in the most time efficient manner and desire to understand Camera Raw in all its glory, do not pass this book up.I originally purchased the prior version of this book, but found the detailed information on the updated Camera Raw and Bridge programs so valuable that I'm not sorry that I also purchased this version."	2005-08-31

Both go on their separate ways yet Orelia cannot forget her savior.  Months later, Orelia travels to London with her cousin Caroline.  Caroline has lived a rather wild life due to the unhappiness of unrequited love.  But Caroline tells Orelia that she is now engaged to a wealthy Marquis of Ryde!  Once in London, they remain in the Marquis's home with his mother as their chaperone.  The Dowager Duchess turns out to be a nasty villain who really never gets her due in the end.   <br /> <br />Of course the Marquis turns out to be the man who saved Orelia.  But he does not appear to even remember the kiss, as Orelia finds herself falling in love with him.  She begins to understand why he has a cold nature, yet is unafraid of him.  She expresses her feelings to him and in turn the Marquis begins to open up to her.  He eventually tells her the kiss meant everything to him but he must honor his betrothal to her cousin even though neither is in love.  It appears to be an unhappy marriage in the making as the wedding day approaches.   <br /> <br />Although you either love Cartland books or not, I was pleased to find this heroine had a little backbone.  Orelia fought for the people she came in contact with, whether it was the Marquis's nephew or just a servant.  She stood up for what was right and I think astonished the Marquis with her knowledge and convincing arguments.  There are some frightening situations involving a kidnapping and other assorted adventures.  This longer Cartland novel allowed for some more situations than are normally in her books.  <br /> <br />Truly enjoyable and memorable characters.     <br />	2005-08-31

Beat! Drums!\\" as his early contribution to the war effort. His brother George enlisted in the army and after he was wounded at Fredericksburg, Walt went to nurse him. Seeing the suffering of the wounded men moved him greatly, and he volunteered in the military hospitals in Washington. Faithfully Whitman attended to the wounded. Two volumes came out of this experience: DRUM-TAPS (poems) and SPECIMEN DAYS (reminiscences). He made many friends in the hospitals. It's this period in Whitman's life that Morris writes about. He captures the despair and courage that all were going through well. He looks at the poems produced by Whitman during this time as well at Whitman the man. Years later Whitman was dismayed that the war for most people had faded into distant memory. As a detailed look at a relatively short (though profound) period in Whitman's life, Morris's book will not fade into distant memory for most who read it."	2005-08-31

I bought this book because of the rave reviews on Amazon.com. I am a Flash ActionScripter who was looking to see how I can make use of design patterns. Actionscript 2.0 is very similar to Java so understanding the examples was no problem.<br />The book if you page through it is silly but if you read it the way it is supposed to be read, you will see into your code further down the road and into the future and figure out that there is at least one certainty and that is that the code will change.<br />Learning about design patterns and OOA/D will 1) prepare your code to handle that inevitable change by decreasing the probably that it will break and 2) it will provide you with a broader vocabulary to express those parts of a program and be able to communicate it with other developers.<br />I recommend this book not at novice ActionScripters but those who are intermediate or advanced who have a confortable grasp of the syntax. This is a good read for those who want to make better use of AS2.0 and stop coding themselves into a corner by coding to concrete classes instead of interfaces. Moocks take on design patterns left alot to be desired but I have to admit that he opened the door for me to learn more about patterns and how it can make life easier developing in Flash.	2005-08-31

The book follows the pattern of the series &quot;Cultures of the World&quot; discussing the country in topics as widely ranging as geography and food. In each chapter Dubois provides an adequate presentation of major factors influencing Colombian life. In many chapters, however she omits 'illustrative details' which perhaps are the hallmark of the entire series. The 'illustrative detail' technique appears in either sideboxes or within the main text. It focuses on a minor item ranging in length from a few sentences to seldom more than a couple of paragraphes. By its similiarity or difference with major factors, it establishes an individual identity for the country, unique among all others. The &quot;Cultures of the World series is 'officially' intended for 'juvenile readers'. Some 'adult'travelguides attempt to use the 'illustrative detail'<BR>technique but seldom as successfully, perhaps because they melt into the homogenizing influences of international business.<BR>  Dubois seems to limit use of illustrative detail technique to three chapters. In the chapter &quot;Religion&quot; she mentions a cathedral, seating up to 15,000 people, built in a former saltmine. This serves not simply as a curiousity, but as an illustration of close ties between big business and the conservative Roman Catholic of Colombia. Similiar usage occurs in the &quot;Lifestyle&quot; and &quot;Colombians&quot; (peoples of Colombia) making these three chapters as the heart of the book.<BR>  Photos also contribute much to the book and to the illustrative detail technique. In &quot;Lifestyle&quot; (62) a photo shows the dedication of Amerindian students and their teacher studying simply under a roof in the rainforest.<BR>  If each chapter was as good as these three chapters, the book would be excellent. As it stands, the book serves as auseful introduction to life in Colombia with some brighter hilites embedded in an adequate but average presentation.	2005-08-31

Jane Austen was born in 1775 in southwest England. She was born to a middle-class family, and her background greatly influenced her writing, which is evident in Pride and Prejudice.<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice is the story of Elizabeth Bennet and her family. Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth's mother, wants nothing more than for her five daughters to be married off to wealthy men as soon as possible. Lydia and Kitty, the two youngest daughters, like to flirt with the officers that are stationed in a nearby town. Mary is content to sit at home and read books. Jane, the oldest daughter, grows attached to Mr. Bingley, a wealthy, single man who recently moved to town. Elizabeth is a lively girl who always speaks what she feels. She begins to have a relationship with Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley's extremely wealthy friend. She denies a marriage proposal twice in the book, much to her mother's dismay.<br /><br />The title Pride and Prejudice is an example of some of the issues Jane Austen talks about throughout the novel. Most of the characters in this book show signs of pride and prejudice in their behavior. Characters in all classes have prejudices against each other. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are prime examples of the pride and prejudice that occurs during the novel. They both have a tendency to judge harshly, even against each other. Their pride keeps them from expressing their true feelings.<br /><br />This was an excellent book, and I recommend it to anyone looking to read a great classic. At first it seemed a little slow, but the book became more interesting as it went along and I truly enjoyed reading it. Though I don't normally enjoy such flowery language, it seemed to fit this story and the characters very well.  Once I got used to the language of the book, I really got into it and it was fun to read.  This book had interesting characters and a happy ending. I woulddefinitely choose Pride and Prejudice as my favorite classic book.	2005-08-31

When death should occur, people have particular ways in which they want ceremonies and burial to be performed. Most often, these last wishes are granted, but sometimes problems arise. When these wishes present hardship, how far would you go to achieve someone's dying wish? In this novel, the Bundren family is placed in this exact predicament.<br /><br />  The novel is set in a small rural section of Mississippi. There on a small farm, resides the dysfunctional family of Anse and Addie Bundren and their five children. The novel opens in revealing that Addie, an unloving mother and wife, is nearing death. With every passing day, the true relationship between the parents and their children is revealed.<br /><br /> While two of their sons, Darl and Jewel, are gone on a trip, Addie passes away. After a bleak funeral service in the county, Addie is placed in a coffin, made by her son Cash, and loaded into the wagon. Here begins her journey home, her dying wish.<br /><br /> As they travel, the stench of the body and weather conditions become worse. Upon arrival at the river, they discover that the bridges are flooded. Once deciding which bridge is most stable, they attempt to cross it.  When doing so, the wagon is tipped and the mules and coffin flow into the surging river, along with Cash. Jewel manages to rescue the coffin, but the mules drown in the chaos. Cash remarkably survives, but with a broken leg.<br /><br /> That night the family takes shelter in a local barn, but sleeps outdoors due to the stench. In attempt to save his family from any more distress, Darl sets fire to the barn. Yet again, Jewel saves the coffin and the journey continues.<br /><br /> One can only wonder if they will ever make it to Jefferson and fulfill Addie's wish.<br /><br />About the Author:<br /><br /> William Faulkner was also born and raised in a small poverty stricken town in Mississippi. At this time, Mississippi was the poorest state in the nation. Here he attended school through high school, but never graduated. In his own life, much inspiration for As I Lay Dying can be found.<br /><br />Emotional response:<br /><br /> Throughout this novel I felt disgust for the characters and their actions. Even though it was Addie's wish to be buried in Jefferson it was disgraceful to her in the manner that her body was treated. The most disgusting display in the novel is in Vardaman's actions to help his mother breathe. Being a young child, he does not understand death, and due to this lack of knowledge, he drills holes in the coffin which bore into his mother's face. Though many of the actions taken are distasteful, it demonstrates the author's amazing ability to \\"paint a wonderful picture.\\" Faulkner has a vivid, eloquent style of writing which allows the reader to witness the poverty and hardship of the Bundrens."	2005-08-31

Having just finished getting her masters degree, she's ready to take her company to the top.  Everything thing seems to be working out.  She's moved back home to Silver Springs; her oldest sister Kiera is in her last year of medical school, and, Isabel, her baby sister, is getting ready to start her first year of college.  However, things start to go bad and, once they do, everything goes downhill -- fast.  First she's nearly killed in an explosion, then she learns that prior to her death, her mother hocked everything Kate owns, and then some.  When her best friend, Jordan Buchanan, gets some disturbing information from her doctor and needs surgery, Kate rushes to Boston to be by her side.  That would have been fine, if Dylan Buchanan hadn't shown up just when she was near the end of her rope and then had the nerve to let her seduce him.  She's determined to go back home heart-whole and figure out what to do about the financial disaster she is facing; unfortunately, she no sooner gets home than she is nearly killed again, twice.  Maybe she's got really bad karma -- or maybe someone wants her dead.  Whatever the case, when Dylan finds out about the trouble she's in, nothing will keep him away.<br /><br />Boston Police Detective Dylan Buchanan is on leave after being shot on the job.  Kate sat by his bedside in the hospital, and while she doesn't know it, he's aware she was there and hasn't been able to stop thinking about her.  When she shows up in Boston, Dylan makes the most of the situation and \\"let's\\" her seduce him.  But when he wakes up the next morning to find she is gone, old love-em and leave-em Dylan is more than just a little bit put out.  When Jordan asks him to find out who is after Kate, Dylan agrees, even if it's only to give her a piece of his mind.  However, when he arrives in Silver Springs, Dylan quickly realizes that it's not Jordan's overactive imagination; someone is out to get rid of Kate.  Now it's Dylan's job to figure out who is after her and why, and convince the silly woman she's in love with him, while keeping her alive.<br /><br />What neither Dylan nor Kate knows is that a long lost relative has changed his will, leaving Kate as the major beneficiary of his massive estate; in other words, her curmudgeon great-uncle has painted a bulls-eye on Kate.<br /><br />SLOW BURN is classic Julie Garwood.  Unforgettable characters, witty dialogue and romance to melt the heart make SLOW BURN a joy to read.  There is a plethora of suspects in this romantic suspense, and several villains to choose from.  The secondary characters, particularly Jordan, Kiera, and Isabel are wonderful additions and add depth to both Kate and Dylan's personalities as they interact with each other.  As with most of Ms. Garwood's novels, I'm looking forward to more stories about the Buchanan brothers, as well as Jordan Buchanan and Kate's sisters, Isabel and Kiera.  Hopefully, Ms. Garwood has stories planned for all of them!<br /><br />Fast paced, SLOW BURN grabs the readers with the first page.  The charming characters fill the pages with warmth and humor.  The relationships between the main players are engaging.  For a novel with just the right amount of mystery, suspense, and romance, grab a copy of SLOW BURN.

This is a lively, emminently readable, comprehensive tome of Celtic mythology.  This is actually two great books in one tome -- Gods and Fighting Men and Cuchulain of Muirthemne.<br />  Gods and Fighting Men comprise the tales of the early invasions of Ireland, the legends of the Tuatha de Danaan, and the Coming of the Gael (the Mythological Cycle); and also the stories of Finn MacCumhail and his warband/policing force (the Fenian Cycle).<br />  These are the great early myths of Ireland -- become acquainted with The Dagda, Brigit, Ogma, Lugh and the other Gods and Heroes of the early mythology.  Even in the time of the Fenians, the Gods and Goddesses still walked the earth and travelled among mortal men.  Although these legends are the foundational mythology of Ireland, this body of lore is generally under-represented in books of Irish Myth.<br />  Cuchulain of Muirthemne covers the Ulster Cycle, the great legends of northern Ireland, in the time of Cuchulain.  War chariots, urban settings and cattle raids with special guest cameos by the now aloof and removed Goddesses and Gods.<br />  This is a phenomenal collection of mythology; highly recommended.

It's as if the man was some kind of a bottomless source of material, long after his folksinging days.  I guess this makes sense.  Friend and fellow activist Pete Seeger is responsible for some of the best picture books out there today, so why not take Guthrie's already family friendly child song fare and make it palatable to the children of the 21st century?  It's probably just a matter of time before Bob Dylan, Joan Baez, and Joni Mitchell do the same.  But until Ani DiFranco starts getting in on the act, let's examine one of Guthrie's lesser-known songs.  It's a fun little conceit but also a harmless little bit of fluff that won't stick in your brain much longer than a reading or two.<br /><br />Where do babies come from?  Well, sir, that's a mighty fine question.  If it were asked in seriousness we'd have to go pull out a copy of \\"Where Willy Went\\" by Nicholas Allan.  Fortunately, it is not and we instead watch a floppy-hatted guitar-strumming kid rhapsodizing on the subject.  \\"The flowers bring some, the trees bring some, the birds bring some, the cars bring some...\\".  One of the most amusing ways they might come, however, is via a kind of new baby train.  In his mind, the narrator sees himself catching such a train and finding it filled with babies ready to go to new homes.  When the conductor tells the boy to hop on board, he meets the infants already there and enjoys the ride.  The boy and babies sing together, partake of some especially tasty bottles, and nap a little while.  By the end, every baby has found its place, including one that's just come home with the boy.<br /><br />I have to say, illustrator Marla Frazee knows how to pick 'em.  I imagine she felt she'd hit gold when she found herself paired with an author like the inimitable Guthrie.  Talk about illustrating the words of giants!  Frazee's an impressive name in the children's literary world in her own right, I should note.  Her \\"Roller Coaster\\" is repeatedly requested by tots and her \\"Hush Little Baby: A Folk Song With Pictures\\" proves that she was already well-acquainted with both folksongs and the Dust Bowl long before \\"New Baby Train\\" landed in her lap.  The book itself invokes the dirt and hard labor of the Great Depression.  Pullman Porters, dusty farmlands, and babies reading the Hobo News (the word \\"STRIKE\\" is nice and bright on the front page) are all present here.  There are plenty of in-jokes for parents familiar in any way with Guthrie's life and works and the babies are beautifully multicultural, so that's one less thing to worry about.  Frazee's so careful that she even makes the undersides of the babies bare feet dark with the dirt of the road.  Of course, while there's nothing wrong with the book per say, it is a little confusing.  First the boy seems to be pretending that he's on the baby train.  Next thing you know you're at the end of the book and there's an honest-to-goodness baby there with him.  Still, I have a hard time resisting this work.  I mean, kids who read this story multiple times will discover that each baby is easy to spot and follow the story of.  It's nice that the one that goes home with the boy is also the only one that sang along with his guitar.<br /><br />I guess this book is just a matter of taste.  Some people will love it and some will scratch their heads trying to figure out what to make of it.  I do think that it's a bit confusing at times and I certainly wouldn't check it out when a child asks about the origin of babies in all seriousness.  It also would've been nice if the book had included a recording of the original song.  This would clear up the confusion surrounding the fact that this book never attempts to rhyme.  Bear that in mind if reading it aloud.  Try pairing this book instead with other baby friendly titles like \\"Baby Brains\\" by Simon James or \\"The Day the Babies Crawled Away\\" by Peggy Rathmann.  As it stands, I don't believe that this is the best Woody Guthrie book turned into picture book form, but it certainly stands on its own two feet just fine., I don't believe that this is the best Woody Guthrie book turned into picture book form, but it certainly stands on its own two feet just fine. <br />"	2005-08-31

The slim volume is well worth the modest price and is a much-needed accompaniment to standard beginning texts that focus on grammar and cultural readings written in more sophisticated Italian.  A workbook (Eserciziario per Diario della studentessa Jean) is also available and  provides valuable, structured exercises for developing competency in the language.  I highly recommend Diario for its straightforward style that encourages beginning students to write and speak with greater ease about everyday experiences.	2005-08-31

Tessa kept repeating the same mistakes in her relationship with Kahn; he grew more quickly, in my opinion. I found many of the sex scenes distasteful and lacking in real connection to the plot or relationship. The balance of romance, sex, and sci-fi was off, and the author used too much repetition.

I read this book when it first came out twenty years ago. At the time I didn't understand the politics described in the book. I saw it as an adventure with Dolphins and Humans working together to escape the evil alien armadas.  The story ends with a cliffhanger like so many others of Brin's books. So I waited patiently for the next book but it never came.  I read The Postman and Earth (Read Earth) but they were not Uplift stories.  I didn't read any Brin for a while then I came back and read the Jijo trilogy and quickly realized that S.R. is part of that story.  When I finished Heaven's Reach I went back and re-read Startide Rising.  I saw it in a whole new light.  I could now see the political and historical implications of what the Streaker crew had found.  I did get lost a little with the super dolphin part.  That didn't seem to fit in the story very well.  Some of the characters are used but I couldn't keep track of all of them.  There were parts when someone would die and I would not recognize the character. Brin tries to use Sci-Fi names like Sah`ot and Karrank% but names that I cannot pronounce make it harder to read.  Is it Karrankpercent?  I understand that in the 80's writers where trying to make up words that aliens would use but nowadays it's just easier to use words with correct spelling rules.   <br />The story is simple but Brin likes to throw a monkey wrench in the simple part.  He has brought in so many aliens that Streaker cannot escape.  He comes up with a really clever way to get the good guys and dolphins on top while making the aliens look like stuck-up, conceded, self indulgent yahoos.   <br />I recommend this book but only if you plan on reading all the Uplift books.  It is a part of a whole and it doesn't really stand on its own. <br />	2005-08-31

It does take a number of pages to really get into - because it's so different from other books, you need that time to really absorb it.<br /><br />This is one of the best written books I have ever read.  No exaggeration.  The story moves forward smoothly despite moving back and forth through time at random intervals.  All the characters are well developed and you are so drawn into the book that you can't wait to finish it even though you wish it would go on forever.<br /><br />The book spans from Clare's early childhood till old age.  Throughout her life, Henry keeps turning up where she is; he cannot control where or when in time he travels but somehow always manages to find her.  Their love is so real and powerful that you can feel it.  A warning, though:  Because the story is so real, parts of it will have you bawling, even if you're one of those people who claims you never cry over books.<br /><br />There are also a few scenes that seem to go on longer than they should, but overall, there is very little I'd want changed.

Well, fellow readers, if you suspected, you were right and Lovehandles is their story.<br /><br />Peter \\"Punch\\" O'Brien and Judy Bently have been partners on their morning show for a year now and they drive each other crazy. Their bantering back and forth sends ratings high, though since listeners love the interaction between the two. Something has changed however in the past few months, being noticed for the first time at the wedding of Ethan and Mary, the contestants from the contest WVLH sponsored over the summer, who found love in the cab of a truck.<br /><br />Now suddenly things are not the same for Punch and Judy as they discover maybe they feel more for each other then just camaraderie and friendship... and business. Peter was burned years ago in a relationship with a coworker so has sworn off getting involved with women that he works with. Judy believes no man could ever be attracted to her, especially someone as incredibly handsome as Peter. But as sparks continue to fly and things heat up, will they discover happiness with each other and prove once again that at WLVH, \\"love is more then just a song?\\"<br /><br />Peter and Judy are total opposites in everything they think and do, grating on each other's nerves all the while the friendship between them grows. Judy is a simple woman with simple hopes and dreams, never asking for anything spectacular. She moves through her life, content in the path she has chosen, even if she sometimes wonders whether she'll ever turn the head of a man who appeals to her. Peter is drop-dead gorgeous, full of charm that women of all ages can't resist. He's perfectly happy cruising through relationships on a very regular basis, never developing anything beyond a casual fling. When Judy starts to realize there is more between them then just friendship, it scares her because she is a \\"forever\\" kind of woman and Peter is a \\"just for now\\" kind of man. As readers watch their relationship grow and change, they'll cheer them on to discovering that what they really want... and need... is each other.<br /><br />As always in a book by Holly Jacobs, humor abounds and brings joy and laughter to the hearts of the readers. One will laugh out loud at the antics of these two lovebirds and at the crazy events their boss has them participating in to boost ratings even more. Sparkling wit and sometimes quirky dialogue keeps one reading through the end of the story, just waiting to see what Peter and Judy will be up to next.<br /><br />Secondary characters are always strong additions to any story by Ms. Jacobs, and this book is no exception. There is even a sweet side story that develops throughout the book, with a romance brewing for a couple of them. That additional sub-plot adds depth to the story, rounding it out to an even more compelling story.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, May 2005.

I had heard about it and rushed out to the store to buy it the day it came out. With that in mind, finishing the book was a disappointment for a number of reasons. <br />1. It was kind of boring. It took me weeks to get into. The book opens extremely slow and stays that way for quite a while. <br />2. The ending sucked. What a waste. I really feel like the author just got tired of writing and decided to wrap everything up quickly. I'd say more, but wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone. <br />3. When you find out what Dracula's been up to for all these years, Who Cares! Blah, boring, and kind of silly. I mean, really. The author couldn't come up with anything more interesting? <br />4. I find it beyond belief that after centuries of people looking for Dracula, including a whole specialized unit of turkish soldiers, it takes Paul and Helen so little time (a matter of days) to finally track him down. <br />5. The coincidences are astonishingly convenient. <br /> <br />I finished this book and said to my husband, \\"Huh. I feel like I just wasted my time.\\" <br /> <br />All that being said, there were things I liked about the book. <br />1. I loved the descriptions of eastern Europe. I flew through the Ljubljana airport a number of times and always thought the countryside looked beautiful, but never visited the city. I enjoyed reading the descriptions of the cities and countries and daydreamed about getting to see them one day.  <br />2. I liked the main character. I envied the girl, growing up in Amsterdam, seeing so much of Europe, being exposed to so many languages. In my schools growing up, I don't think I was exposed to a foreign language until high school, when it's almost too late.  <br /> <br />Some reviews have compared this book with \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" That's unfair and the two books have nothing to do with one another beyond being set in Europe and dealing with events and people hundreds of years in the past.  <br /> <br />In a nutshell, I didn't think the book was all that good and 3 stars might be generous, but there were things I did like about it. I just wish I'd waited and bought the book in paperback or used."	2005-08-31

Unfortunately, there was a siege going on outside the walls of her keep. In a bold plan to save her people and secure her own freedom, Reyna disguised herself as a courtesan and set out to seduce and kill the leader of the invading army. Instead, Reyna is almost taken by Ian of Guilford, a notorious mercenary skilled in battle and even more skilled with women. Barely escaping with her virtue, she unwittingly gives Ian the knowledge to take the keep. Now Reyna finds herself a pawn with her very life in the balance.<br /><br />Was she a grieving widow or a cold-blooded murderer? Ian of Guilford is fascinated and most definitely attracted to the lady of Black Lyne Keep. Spirited yet haunted, the studious Reyna is unlike the ladies of the court that Ian had known before. When Ian is offered Black Lyne Keep and Reyna's hand in marriage, he leaves her little choice but to accept. Now he will stop at nothing to uncover all his bride's secrets.<br /><br />Madeline Hunter has won droves of accolades and fans with her distinctive stories. While LORD OF A THOUSAND NIGHTS may not be as strong as her other work, it still provides an engrossing trip to a period in history when women were often caught in the middle of the politics of men. Ian and Reyna are made all the more interesting by their very human flaws and the twists and turns of the plot keep the action moving along at a brisk pace. The final verdict? If you've read the rest of Ms. Hunter's work, LORD OF A THOUSAND NIGHTS is definitely worth reading. However, if this is your first Madeline Hunter book, be warned. Given the presence of characters -- some of whom are pivotal to the plot -- from previous books, it would help to read the other stories in this medieval series.<br /><br />TheSchemer	2005-08-31

Brooks' background is in engineering, not programming. His observations are personal opinion, not Absolute Truth. Those who are impressed with this book appear to have little practical experience. Woe to any programmer who disputes his manager because 'Brooks says so'!     This 20th anniversary edition reminds me of an old computer program that has been modified to meet new needs. Chapter 16 through 19 have been added, as if there was no need for any other changes in the earlier chapters. But many of the examples in the earlier chapters became obsolete with virtual programming, faster machines, and bigger memories. The programmers of that Golden Age are now on the beach or have gone underground. The new era of Windows and Intel, with offshore jobs, have turned mainframe programmers into a new version of 19th century whalers and buffalo hunters. As I understand it, the problems of OS/360 were due to: a new machine architecture, a new assembler language, and new people with less experience. In time these problems were overcome. Some might compare the effort to the Union Army in 1861-62,    Chapter 16 speaks of the folklore nightmares of werewolves! Is he kidding? Brooks needs to see \\"Abbot & Costello Meet Frankenstein, Dracula, and the Wolfman\\" to update his knowledge. Software costs have dropped rapidly, as the price for Windows 2000 shows. Brooks confuses mass-production with custom work. You can compare stick-built houses to modular houses, more common outside the USA they say. Software entities are complex because they use general purpose programming languages. A specific purpose language should be less complex. Another advantage of a high-level language is fewer typed characters, and hence fewer typing mistakes that can't be found by a compiler. The advantage to time-sharing is to cut delays, it also makes programming more intensive. The rest of the chapter, pages 188-203 can be skipped. There is a \\"silver bullet\\": offshore programming where programmers are rented for $30 a day compared to $50 an hour state-side. Cottage weavers were eliminated by factory production, and whaling ships by kerosene production.     Chapter 17 has Brooks' comments on replies to his \\"no silver bullet\\" concept. A silver bullet is an alleged particular solution to a specific problem. Did anyone do a field test for this solution? Perhaps a better symbol is needed? Chapter 18 regurgitates the original book in outline form with Brooks' added comments. Did you find this educational?    Chapter 19 asks about the appeal of MM-M. Perhaps it is due to its counter-intuitive claim that adding more labor to a process makes it take longer? Would removing labor from a process make it finish earlier? More new people who don't have experience reduces the average level of knowledge needed for the job. Usually more people means the job is done earlier, as in barn-raising. Talk of a \\"second system\\" implies more experience. Brooks failure to understand this suggests some personal problem. The prevention of \\"featuritis\\" is accomplished by following the needs of users according to priority. Brooks admits his advice \\"to throw one away\\" is wrong (p.265). Page 266 tells of the problem is listening to unproven fantasies. Brooks' comments on \\"fluidity\\" (p.280) seems oriented to entertainment not production (\\"slide presentations\\") The coalescence of operating systems seems similar to automotive manufacturing (who remembers marque-specific engines?) Is \\"software engineering\\" an a priori fantasy? Other engineering creates rules for mass-production (p.286). Programming practice should be concerned with the rules for efficient creation of programs. There is a picture of Brooks on page 228, another on page i. Do you see what I see? What is the usefulness of this book?    [Novice programmers may find Scott Adams' \\"Dilbert Principle\\" better for today's world.]"	2005-08-31

It's hard to believe it was authored by Thom S. Rainer.   The fundamental problem with research stems from the selection criteria for \\"breakout churches\\".  The criteria was so abysmally biased by Rainer's desire not to promote growth that stemmed from the involvement of a new pastor that they only produced 13 churches out of 400,000.  Rather than taking another pass at identifying churches that would energize us in our calling, they instead decided to write a book lauding these 13 churches as the \\"good to great\\" of our time. <br /> <br />Before you put this in your shopping cart consider the criteria led them to the selection of churches who: <br />- Have pastors with an average tenure of 21.6 years with this one church (pg. 57) <br />- Current pastor must have participated in both the declining years, as well as the break-out growth (pg. 16) <br />- None of the 13 churches seek to discover a vision (pg. 111) <br />- \\"Are careful, even plodding in making changes\\" (pg. 150) <br /> <br />If you're looking for a book that will make you feel better about your church which has been declining for years, without giving you much in the way of actionable strategies, you've come to the right place. <br /> <br />I hope Jim Collins received a quarter every time his name, his book title, or a page number in Good to Great was referenced!

Although I am not a big fan of introductions-before-book, this one by Donald Keene helps a lot (the spoilers are few) and is recommended.  Professor Keene's translation style is very limpid and flowing -- one is surprised by the end of Act Eleven when the climactic action sequence is brought to an end.<br /><br />Fans of Bunraku (puppet theatre) and Kabuki should have this book -- and hopefully the National Theatre in Tokyo might offer either version of the play (one can get in and see Bunraku these days for about 40-50 bucks).<br /><br />A note of warning:  as Prof. Keene points out, this work of literature shows the other side of Japanese art  (in contrast to austere restraint, this shows the Japanese love for color and violence) -- but it is not a non-stop action work.  Instead, it deals more with the \\"tests\\" of loyalty (hence the title) each retainer must show in order to be allowed to participate in the final plan to kill their lord's enemy.  In that way, Chushingura is much more about the love the retainers have for their lord than, in my opinion, the hatred and violence they harbor against the enemy.  Uma Thurman in samurai garb, they are not...uh...<br /><br />Fans of Chikamatsu's plays will find this popular work refreshing -- it moves at a much faster pace, with more feints here and there.

A disease breaks out with their cattle that forces them to slaughter the herd; the results have a devastating effect on both characters.

"DUTCH II: Angel's Revenge is street fiction at its finest.  It is gritty, raw and hardcore, and at times downright disturbing.  It is the second installment by Ms. Woods that revolves around the life and times of the infamous drug pin, Bernard \\"Dutch\\"  Murphy.  The story begins with Dutch's trial and his going out, in a haze of gunfire.  We don't know if Dutch is alive or dead, but we do know that Queen Latifah's character Cleo, from the movie \\"Set It Off\\" doesn't have jack on Dutch.  His two lieutenants, Angel and One-eyed Roc, who are now serving life terms in prison, are expected to keep the legacy alive.<br /><br />However, while in prison One-eyed Roc, now known as Rahman, has experienced a conversion to Islam and wants no part of his former underworld dealings. He has a religious agenda to clean up his community, which includes a holy war with all criminal elements in the community.  This will place him into direct conflict with his former friend, Angel.<br /><br />Angel, who is now being released from prison on a legal technicality, has her own plans that are not as worthy as One-eyed Roc.  These plans include continuing Dutch's legacy of violence, drug-selling and just being a menace to society in general, aided and abetted by her girlfriend.  Angel is setting out to turn things upside-down.<br /><br />I am going to be honest.  I did not particularly like Dutch, the first book in the trilogy, because I thought it was a bad knock off version of the movie \\"New Jack City.\\"  The book was slow and repetitive of other books that were out at the time, and I was a little disappointed that Ms. Woods ventured so far from True To The Game, her first book.  I was a big Quadir and Gena fan back in the day and Dutch was so darn heartless. However, I truly enjoyed Dutch II. The pace was faster, the characters interconnected with more ease and the message was clearer.  The characters One-eyed Roc and Angel battle with a realm of emotions and conflict, two strong-willed individuals who both are determined to enforce their own private agendas by any means. Ms. Woods did a fine job of  examining the scope of friendship.  DUTCH II:  Angel's Revenge is suspenseful and dramatic.

Doing that gave me a new appreciation for what Bruce has done with this story. <br /> <br />Told from the perspective of Susan Simmons, the story fairly believably tells a tale of the impossible. Susan discovers that her new teacher, rigid and demanding Mr. Smith, is actually an alien. Furthermore, he has plans to take several of the students back to space with him! If that wasn't enough, he's holding the previous teacher, Ms. Schwarz, prisoner in his house. <br /> <br />The premise may be clearly fantasy-based, but what follows is some very clever storytelling. Susan has to figure out what to do about her situation, which isn't easy when new complications keep arising. But she's not alone. One of the first things Susan does, is attempt to get fellow student Peter Thompson to believe her. Peter, a friendless nerd who Susan gets along with (\\"I realized that I was probably the closest thing he had to a friend\\"), is naturally skeptical at first, but a trip to the teacher/alien's house gives him all the proof he needs. From that point on, the story branches out in a number of surprising directions, with many new twists introduced into the plot, all under an increasingly looming threat. <br /> <br />Bruce Coville tells a brilliant tale with \\"My Teacher Is an Alien\\". The characters are believable, with believable narration told from Susan's perspective, mixing in the descriptions one would expect from a novel with the observations and opinions one would expect from a kid. Bruce fleshes out things more by showing Susan's home life, and hinting at Peter's. The plot branches and twists in surprising, yet believable ways, making for an unpredictable story. The only place I felt the author stumbled was with some of Peter's dialog. While Peter is clearly meant to be an intelligent kid, he makes observations that I as an adult couldn't really imagine a sixth grader making. But when I originally read this book back as a kid, I never felt that Peter was too unrealistic, so it's probably not a concern for many kids. <br /> <br />Overall, I think this book is a classic that stands the test of time. Mixing in the fantastic (aliens) with the familiar (a school setting) makes for a blend that works. <br /> <br />Recommended."	2005-08-31

As it happened, I cracked open the spine a day early. Soon I was wondering: Why does Carr feel he has to adopt an apologist tack for each book's existence? It smacked of authorial insecurity. Next, the narrator's voice threw me for a loop. It's Stevie, I kept telling myself, not Moore. Stevie. Stevie. Stevie. (Even with the contrivance of forced studies, the young Stevepipe was way out of his linguistic league.) As I plowed on, my authenticity radar kept beep beeping with other intercepts.  <br /> <br />By the time I was actually in flight, I whiled away hours with other entertainment options before finally extracting the book. At that point, a young woman across the aisle asked if I liked it.  \\"Well...\\" I hesitated. \\"I'd like to have worked with Carr before he submitted the manuscript. I think he has a lot of talent--creatively, conceptually, and in terms of his ability to execute some pretty amazing sentences, especially in The Alienist--but...\\" <br /> <br />The girl, who happened to be from Dubai, was staring at me. I was going to explain that I was a writer, too, as if that granted me some critical license, which it probably does, but the pilot interrupted with his own treatise on weather conditions.  <br /> <br />So I'll finish here on Amazon, where I have only twice before felt inclined to comment on books. (That in itself a point in Carr's favor.) I appreciate Carr's efforts to enlighten the populace. I appreciate his historical research. But I think much of the time spent in those endeavors would be better invested in working on the craft of writing and in mastering the detective genre. What he's delivering now is good enough for the unsophisticated reader but I don't think it's good enough for him."	2005-08-31

Instead, Atlantis is a dull and laborious read. I found it quite a chore to get though and almost gave up several times. But, I persevered only to find out I really shouldn't have bothered afterall.  <br /> <br />David Gibbins has worked in underwater archaeology all his professional life and is a world authority on sunken wrecks and cities. Well there's the problem: this book is far too technical for the lay person. The parts about Atlantis read like an academic thesis and not a novel. It's almost like Gibbins isn't telling a story but rather writing a thesis about Atlantis.  <br /> <br />Take the discovery of Atlantis' location for instance: the writer dealt with this by having the main characters partake in a LONG LONG discussion about every possible Atlantis myth and about the gold disc they discovered that may reveal Atlantis' location. THAT'S IT!! It lasts several chapters (with a pointless bit of fight the evil terrorist in the middle that just doesn't fit in) and having decided they think they know where Atlantis is, off they go. No intrigue, no mystery, no adventure, NOTHING.... just dry academic discussion before reaching a conclusion and setting off to find the city. I found it very tiresome.    <br /> <br />Ditto when they discover Atlantis. The main characters swim through the sunken city and pass academic comment on what they see.... again that's just about it.  Endless descriptions of architecture, types of wood and metal used and how it was forged, how the doors work, etc and how amazing it all is. Well it may be amazing to the archaeologist but not necessarily to the lay person. I just kept wondering when something would actually happen.   <br /> <br />When the secrets of Atlantis are revealed, it is done again through academic discussion by a bunch of experts. Furthermore, the big secret of Atlantis that was kept a mystery for thousands of year turned out to be something quite mundane. Again, it is something that may be awesome to an archaeologist but not to a lay person.  <br /> <br />Add to all this academic discussion some occasional fighting with an evil warlord from Kazakhstan coupled with some ridiculous clichs (all the heroes are handsome/beautiful and all the bad guys are deformed and ugly) and there you have Atlantis. It is a book that cannot decide what it wants to be: part academic discussion and part implausible bang bang kill the warlord and it just doesn't fit together or work.  <br /> <br />Gibbins should stick to writing academic papers and lecturing in archaeology. This novel is something that may intrigue the archaeologist but for the ordinary reader, it just isn't enough. In fiction writing you have to do better then endless, dry academic observation which is pretty much all there is about the lost city of Atlantis in this book. There's no real story and it badly paced and badly put together.	2005-08-31

Charlie Brown finds his baseball mound covered in dandelions, and gets his baseball team to grit their teeth, with rather funny looking results (Lucy looks hillarious with gritted teeth, which take up half her head!).  <br /> <br />The characters look almost as we'd expect them to, though Schultz would continue to refine them as time went on. At this stage, some of the regular characters, like Peppermint Patty and Woodstock, haven't been introduced yet. <br /> <br />It's worth noting some of the comments Linus makes throughout these strips. He comes back from church school all dressed up, saying that he'd been reading the letters of the apostle Paul.

Courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques<br /><br />This was a fascinating fantasy romance by the talented Karen McCullough that will carry readers away into another world where dragons live and wizards dream.<br /><br />Alsa feels the stirrings of wizardry within her and makes a desperate bargain with a reclusive wizard to expand them. She needs to learn to use her magick to aid her village in winning a battle against amassed enemies who could wipe out everything she has ever known. She asks the wizard Korlen to teach her in the ways of magick and in exchange, she will bear him the son he desires, so as to pass his powers on to the next in his line.<br /><br />Her adventure thus begins when she learns magick is not what she thought, nor is training in her abilities anything she ever would have expected. In the months spent with Korlen, she discovers many hard lessons about his way of life, soon to become hers once her training is complete. Never in a million years though, did either of them expect what the greatest lesson of all would be... that of sacrificing all for love. Can he help her learn what she needs to help her village survive? Can she finally begin to comprehend the choices he has made in his life, and how they will change her forever?<br /><br />This is a delightful story and Ms. McCullough proves once again why she is a rising star in the world of romance. The world-building is vivid and has so many facets to it that readers will feel as though they are in the village with Alsa and her family, or in the castle where she learns wizardry. Landscapes are so beautiful that one senses the faint stirrings of Breath, the air elemental whom Alsa befriends, and feels the pillowy softness of the rainbow bridge under her feet as she crosses into the wizard's lair.<br /><br />Most of the characters are skillfully rendered and full of life, from Dragon, the sulky, yet satisfied guardian of the castle and rainbow bridge, to Dortee, the wizard healer, to Adam the precocious child of Korlen and Alsa. Alsa comes across as a brave and selfless young lady willing to do anything to help the village she loves, yet vulnerable enough to cry over the accidental damage she causes in her lessons in magick.<br /><br />Korlen is a complex individual. He is a loner; having withdrawn from others after something scarred him emotionally in his past, and is afraid to speak of his feelings, even if he's not afraid to show them in other ways. One will love him for his vulnerability at the same time as being frustrated with his refusal to interact with others. The only thing this reviewer would have liked to see regarding him is a look into the events in his past that is alluded to many times throughout the story, but never explained. That is left out and this reviewer can't help but feel that may have made her understand him even more.<br /><br />In short, this is a very satisfying and quick read that will captivate readers from the first page all the way through to the beautiful happy ending.

It's teeny weeny by comparison to blue and green.<br /><br />Simmons says Saudi oil fields will decay as others have before.

"This book is a _beautiful_ example of what Warner Brothers Marketing can do when they put their minds to it (another fine example are the Golden Collection DVD sets!) - essentially a \\"shop\\" manual to the Looney Tunes way of animating and drawing.  Although it should have been noted that most of the focus is on Bugs Bunny, once you get Bugs down, it's all a matter of getting the character look down, as the book demonstrates through vellum overlays, sketch progressions and even completed pieces of artwork how to get action lines correct, tail positions right, paw proportions perfect, etc.  I would list downsides, however there aren't any!  This book is an attractive hardcover for not only the discriminating collector, but for the casual fan, too!  It bookends \\"The Art of Warner Brothers Animation\\" and \\"Bugs Bunny:  50 Years and Only One Grey Hare\\" very well!  The layout is fantastic, and the additional \\"features\\" (fold-out scenery, dissections of perspective drawing, vellum overlays) make this book WELL worth the twenty-some dollars they're getting for it on Amazon (cover price: $40 US!).  If you're a fan of Warner Brothers animation, don't hesitate to dump this book in to your cart!"	2005-08-31

I was sorely disappointed.  The first five thousand years of Iraq's history are summed up in under 100 pages.  The book then slows down and spends a lot of pages on the Ottoman rule of Iraq, followed by European rule.  The book ends with a short synopsis of Iraq under Saddam Hussein and western (i.e. US) involvement through several presidential administrations.  The one subject that received the most attention was understandably oil; specifically the politics and characters involved in it from 1900 - 1950.   <br /> <br />The book misses or shortshrifts many key subjects.  These include: <br /> <br />1. Religious life before Islam, and how Islam spread throughout Iraq.  This spread involved conflict, and as such deserves greater mention in this book.  <br />2. Man's effect on the environment, and how many of the conflicts in Iraq's history pre-1900 were related to control of water, farmland and trade routes. <br />3. Iraq under the rule of the Greeks around the time of Alexander the Great, and later under the rule of the Roman empire.  This is important because many of the Jews and Christians now living in Iraq came there during the rule of the Roman Empire. <br />4. Iraq's long historical relations vis-a-vis the Persians and the Turks. <br />5. The history of Arab nationalism in Iraq starting from the 1800s up till the modern day.  <br /> <br />Overall, the book could be better balanced in the subjects it covers and the time periods it covers.  But what it does cover it does well.  The book is well referenced, and easy to read.  The relationships between Iraq and outside entities (people, corporations, and countries) are well-explained.  Overall, a good book to read, but it does not live up to its title.	2005-08-31

This book was just as captivating and much more exciting than the first!  So much happens in this book and it leaves you excited for the third!! There are twists that I should have expected but didn't.  Christopher did a good job keeping the readers up-to-date with Rowran's situation as well as the Varden's situation as well as Eragon's training.  Most authors make this process confusing, Christopher did it with such magic.  I don't want to tell you too much about what happens, becuase it's a book you must read.  My advice to you, if you have read Eragon, why are you reading these reviews? Go read Eldest!! And if you haven't yet ventured to read Eragon, as long as you like to read fantasy, it's worth every minute you spend reading and more! This is a series for everyone.

Maybe?<br /><br />Cara Romano needs to make an escape... and fast.<br /><br />Cara's mother was arranging surprise visits with all the eligible men she can find, in hopes of winning a bet with a friend, and Cara has had enough! On her spring break from the school she teaches at, she makes a break for Houston, TX, to visit her good friends, Kate and Tony Donetti. Now begins ten days of sheer bliss, away from her mother and her scheming, away from anyone who could possibly track her down. She is going to indulge herself on vacation, doing many of the things she had dreamed about. Her very first day in Texas, she bumps into, quite literally, the man of her dreams... Or should she say fantasies?<br /><br />Rex Noble is a businessman. He just has a different kind of business... a sperm bank for cattle, started with the purchase of his prized bull. A favor to a friend has him getting a new ad campaign going, to keep ahead of competitors, and it has some shocking results. He is livid over the disaster, and this could wreak havoc on his business, but he never expected it would also be a turning point for his personal life as well. Until the day he bumps into a vision of perfect beauty; and no one will tell him who she is.<br /><br />Upon seeing a certain billboard for Noble Sperm Bank, it suddenly hits Cara... she longs for a child more then anything, but can do without the husband to get one. What better solution then to go to the sperm bank for artificial insemination? The more she thinks about it, the more she loves the idea, especially when her imaginings about the donor take on the visage of a rather sexy Texan. She is more then a little surprised to find the doctor at the sperm bank is none other then her fantasy man, but is even more surprised to realize this is not the type of sperm bank she was looking for! Afraid to admit her mistake, she plays along, hoping to indulge in a little fling with her sexy doctor, and maybe get some sperm the old fashioned way! Rex is happy to oblige, at first, until he begins to suspect her reasons for seeking out his business in the first place.<br /><br />What can a person say? This book was hilarious! The bet between Cara's mother, and her friend (whose daughter is featured in the second story of this Duets volume) is a good premise for the stories and adds an extra margin of humor. Plenty of borderline slapstick comedy occurs throughout the book as well, in the by-play between Rex and Cara.<br /><br />Cara is the stereotypical elementary school teacher, until she decides to let loose and have a ball on her vacation. Her inner musings about who she was and who she wants to be are a nice look at why she is the way she is. When she decides what she really wants is a baby, she sets out to reach that goal right away, hoping to surprise everyone when she goes home. No one would ever expect reserved Cara to go and do something crazy like get artificially inseminated!<br /><br />Rex is a perfect hero, tall dark and handsome, crazy enough about Cara to imitate a Romeo and Juliet type scene when he doesn't even know her name. When she shows up at his clinic and spins him a story about wanting to buy a farm, excuse me, ranch!, and some cattle, he is surprised but pleased. He was intrigued by her before he knew her and was even more so after hearing her \\"plan,\\" and jumps on the chance to assist her.<br /><br />When these two get together, their mutual fascination flares out of control, igniting a passion neither was expecting. What Cara had intended for a fling, turns into something more, that she hopes he wants as well. It also adds plenty of opportunity for the addition of even more humor to the story, making the reader laugh out loud at what could be rather inopportune moments, depending on where the book is being read. Though this reviewer is sorry to see the Harlequin Duets series end, they could not have picked a better book to use as the grand finale. Also, this is one reviewer who looks forward to seeing more from Ms. Tucker hopefully in the new Flipside line.<br /><br />© Kelley A. Hartsell, September 2003.

I bought this book because of the rave reviews on Amazon.com. I am a Flash ActionScripter who was looking to see how I can make use of design patterns. Actionscript 2.0 is very similar to Java so understanding the examples was no problem. Most people would recommend &quot;Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software&quot; (a.k.a. GoF, Gang Of Four) but that's a tough read. The examples in a copy I got were done in C Language.<br />The book if you page through it is silly but if you read it the way it is supposed to be read, you will see into your code further down the road and into the future and figure out that there is at least one certainty and that is that the code will change.<br />Learning about design patterns and OOA/D will 1) prepare your code to handle that inevitable change by decreasing the probably that it will break and 2) it will provide you with a broader vocabulary to express those parts of a program and be able to communicate it with other developers.<br />I recommend this book not at novice ActionScripters but those who are intermediate or advanced who have a confortable grasp of the syntax. This is a good read for those who want to make better use of AS2.0 and stop coding themselves into a corner by coding to concrete classes instead of interfaces. Moocks take on design patterns left alot to be desired but I have to admit that he opened the door for me to learn more about patterns and how it can make life easier developing in Flash.	2005-08-31

The author makes no attempt to take advantage of the wonderful expressiveness of the Smalltalk language. Classes and methods have been given awkward names; the source code is not elegant; basic objects such as matrices and polynomials are insufficiently modeled and treated as mere data structures; algorithms are not viewed as objects but as conventional procedures. Because of the flatness of the approach the resulting programming style is ugly when compared to Smalltalk standards.

After all, if 'dir' or 'ls' don't show what you're looking for, maybe an undelete program will work. Or will it? To be a decent, trustworthy expert in forensics (a requirement if you plan to participate in any criminal investigations), you'll have to learn how filesystems really operate, how tools like undelete and lazarus work, and how they can be defeated.<br /><br />Carrier's book isn't a legal book at all, and it doesn't pretend to offer much insight into the law surrounding forensics. Instead it focuses on technical matters, and is sure to be the gold standard in its field. This is important, because it comes at you expecting you to have some knowledge, even if only informal, of what a filesystem contains. With a basic understanding of data structures, you'll get a wealth of information out of this book, and it will be a good reference long after you've first studied it.<br /><br />File System Forensic Analysis is divided into three sections. These are arranged in the order that you'll want to study them to maximize the benefit you can hope to achieve, namely an understanding of how to examine filesystems for hidden or previously stored data. The first three chapters cover a fundamental series of topics: Digital Investigation Foundations, Computer Foundations, and an introduction to Hard Disk Data Acquisition. While they start at a basic level (e.g. what hexadecimal is), they quickly progress to more developed topics, such as the types of interfaces (SATA, SCSI, IDE), the relationship of the disk to the computer system as a whole, and how data is stored in a file and filesystem at a basic level. A lot of examples given use Linux, due to the raw, accessible nature of UNIX and UNIX-like systems, and the availability of tools like 'dd' to gather data.<br /><br />Part 2 covers \\"Volume Analysis,\\" or the organization of files into a storage system. This introduces the basics of things like partition tables (including how to read one). The next few chapters cover PC-based partitions (DOS and Apple), server-based partitions (BSD, Solaris and GPT partitions), and then multiple disk volumes like RAID and logical volumes. With this introduction, the final chapter of the section covers how to use these filesystem descriptions in practice to look for data during analysis. Filesystem layouts, organization, and things like journals and consistency checks are covered with a clarity and exactness that's refreshing for such a detailed topic.<br /><br />Having covered the basics of filesystems, Part 3 covers the bulk of the book and material. Several chapters follow that specifically show you how to analyze particular filesystems by using their data structures to direct your reads. A range of filesystems are covered, including FAT, NTFS, EXT2 and EXT3, and the BSD types UFS1 and UFS2. Each filesystem has two chapters, one devoted to concepts and analysis, another entirely about data structures. Dividing each filesystem type like this lets Carrier focus first on the theory of each filesystem and its design, and then the practical use of its design to actually understand how to pull data off of it.<br /><br />The real strength of File System Forensic Analysis lies in Carrier's direct and clear descriptions of the concepts, the completeness of his coverage, and the detail he provides. For example, a number of clear, well-ordered and simple diagrams are peppered throughout the book, explaining everything from allocation algorithms to NTFS alternative data streams. This use of simple diagrams makes the topics more easily understood, so the book's full value can be appreciated. This is the kind of thing that sets a book apart from its peers and makes it a valuable resource for a long time.<br /><br />Finally, Carrier brings it all together and shows us how many aspects of filesystems can be examined using his \\"sleuth kit\\" tools, freely available and easy to use. Without appearing to hawk this tool at the expense of other valuable resources, you get to see how simple and direct filesystem manipulations can be done using a direct approach. This kind of presentation is what makes File System Forensic Analysis a great foundation.<br /><br />Overall I'm pleased with File System Forensic Analysis, I think that Carrier has achieved what few technical authors do, namely a clear explanation of highly technical topics which retains a level of detail that makes it valuable for the long term. For anyone looking seriously at electronic forensics, this is a must have. I suspect people who are working on filesystem implementations will also want to study it for its practical information about NTFS. Overall, a great technical resource..

SO excited!  It's chock-full of information about lots of fun destinations.  However, when I started to plan places to go, I found the book very hard to use.  The book will give an instruction like \\"drive on Hwy 30 towards Lahaina\\".  Since no starting point is established, it's up to you to figure out if the instructions are for drivers headed north vs. south!  This is key.  Maui Revealed is much better in this regard, because it uses terms like \\"mauka\\" (meaning mountain-side) and \\"makai\\" (meaning water-side).  Hence, the directions make sense regardless of your approach!  With much effort, one can use the maps provided in Maui Trailblazer, along with relative positions of sites listed in the text, to figure out how to find these fantastic sounding places.  But when you're on the road, actually *navigating*, you don't have time to mess about with that kind of work.  This is vacation, after all."	2005-08-31
US	40350635	R14ZHUKBZDJ30X	159315237X	447056092	Creepers	Books	3	2	7	False	True	Nobody likes bad reviews...	I preordered this book.  Im a huge Morrell fan.  Its a fast read easily done in 8 hrs or so but not one of his best.  Its probably closest too Burnt Sienna in quality but the lead character reminds me of The Protector.   <br /> <br />The hero of the story is prior military and at first you think it will be one of the prior special- forces- with- some- black- ops-secret-training type guys. but it isnt quite that way.  The story is one tragic blow after another to the characters.  They never get the edge up on their ( numerous ) attackers.   <br /> <br />The book is well written of course and has a good creepy atmosphere ( no pun intended )   I recommend you wait until paperback on this one or, if you havent read them, read Fraternity of the STone or Brotherhood of the Rose.  Two of his best.	2005-08-31
US	48875865	R1XWM6T74DXUS5	1931709017	32796023	A Century of Catholic Converts	Books	4	5	6	False	False	Helpful, interesting, and worthwhile read	This fine descriptive work traces a number of conversion narratives, highlighting various points in the lives of these Catholic converts. I found the references for further reading very helpful. There is little to no commentary accompanying the narratives; the author lays out the events and lets them speak for  themselves.  The book is divided into decades and offers a brief overview of the historical moment in which the conversions in that section took place, which I found important for context. <br /> <br />The book works well as an entry into other, more in-depth readings/narratives about the converts whose stories we witness in these pages.  It is a necessary addition to the ranks of extant collections of Catholic conversion stories, providing encouragement to those on their way to Rome and for those interested in faith turning points in a complex century.	2005-08-31

Not that I didn't thoroughly enjoy Taubman...up until the point that Kennedy was assassinated.  Somehow, without Kennedy to reflect off of, or react off of, or bark at, or explode at, Khruschev became rather dull.<br /><br />This book, winding as it does completely around the relationship between the leaders of the two superpowers, their mistrusts of each other, their odd affection for each other, their correspondence, and their dangerous, global risk-taking flare-ups, proves far more interesting.  Beschloss creates characters full of life and vigor, sympathetic and sometimes frightening, as when Khruschev threatens war over Berlin, or when we learn the details of the narcotics the President required to manage his back pain.<br /><br />The book also manages to set the stage for years and years of politics to come, in space policy, in cold war strategy, and in the Vietnam war.	2005-08-31

I love the way the practical how-to facts come from the actual life-stories of top talent who have done it. It's a great way to learn and it's filled with life-lessons born out of many, many years of hard knocks experience. The many different pints of view make all the difference in finding one's personal place within a complicated industry. This book is written by the people who know the voice-over industry and, in some cases, pioneered it! Joan Baker truly delivers on the secrets of the industry and I applaud her and her fabulous contributors for their generosity in letting it all hang out.

These accumulated life experiences influence the current, active lifetime on a subconscious level,and some traumatic experiences leave troubling footprints on one's current life. Dr.Newton (Ph.D.)shows through case histories of patients who have been \\"regressed\\" (scientific and verifiable), that a contemporary stumbling block can resolved by identifying the trauma that created it. For example, a mystifying pain in this lifetime can be a \\"soul memory\\" of an injury in a past life; or a current pathological fear of water is from a \\"soul memory\\" of drowning in a past life. Then there are the souls who are so deeply connected that they have share many lifetimes as siblings, and close friends, and spouses. What was most fascinating to me was the \\"memory\\" of what happens between lives, when we return to our \\"soul groups,\\" review our lives, see what lessons we have learned and which ones we have to try again. In short, life is school for the soul. Is there matriculation? Yes, in a sense there is in that we learn and move on. Are there trips to the principals office? Oh yes. Souls who do terrible things in a lifetime go through what we might call \\"deep reprogramming.\\" But the best part of all is that we come from and return to a system of self- and mutual respect and love.There is randomness to life, yes, but we are neither puppets nor chips lost on a raging river. Some people experience recognition while reading this book. One woman said, \\"I knew that! I knew that!\\" and felt empowered to take control of her life and stop drifting. It's a life-changing book."	2005-08-31

While I didn't really care for the whole Anna/Adam Anna/Ben thing I did like that the character Sam is starting to develop some personality & I think I'm going to like her newfound friendship with Anna.<br /><br />Anna's sister Susan was great guest character which gave Anna a bit more depth and the argument she & Anna have near the end is done beautifully. Something about this book that annoyed me was Cammie. I absolutely that girl and she should just get this stupid vendetta with Anna over with because it gives really no personality at all.<br /><br />Like I said before a much better improvement from the first book, and I think Ms.Dean has a pretty strong hold of the book already, where I felt it took Ms.Von Ziegesar 3 books into the series of Gossip Girl before she could do something decent with her characters.<br /><br />Good work Ms. Dean & keep it coming<br /><br />Ciao"	2005-08-31

It also has useful maps for locating the hikes, and provided helpful information for the one hike I have taken with its help. This was the first hike listed in the book, to the top of Mt. Alander. <br /> <br />The less than perfect score reflects serious deficiencies in the guide to this hike. First, poetic descriptions of landscape and wildlife obscured important directions. Second, there was no indication of the actual distance between the landmarks buried in the descriptions. <br /> <br />The most serious deficiency has to do with directions to the summit. These were very brief and gave way to an extensive and ecstatic account of the views from the top. The trail to the top forks, and there was no indication in the guide of which fork to take. The right fork I took led away from the views so ecstatically described. The most serious problem was the absence of any indication of how to get down from the summit. Trying to retrace my steps, I came upon a sign pointing to landmarks in New York State. Fortunately I ran into two experienced hikers who pointed out the best line of descent and got us back on the trail to the parking area in Massachusetts.	2005-08-31

Sandrine hadn't forgotten the thrilling passion she'd shared with her husband. But when only six months after their wedding, Michel Lanier had forced her to choose between her career and their marriage...Sandrine had to walk away. Michel had won her heart, but he couldn't rule her life! Now Sandrine's career was facing a crisis, and only Michel could help her. He would do so, but for a price: Sandrine must agree to share her husband's life, and his bed, once more!<br /><br />Comment:<br /><br />I really like Helen Bianchin but the conflict between the hero and heroine seemed quite silly in my opinion. After reading the book I was still puzzled on why the heroine left, why the hero let her leave, and why the hero had to contrive some set up to get his wife back. What was lacking in this book was some big fight or event that separated the two. Not just some silly fight about Sandrine's acting career and her signing a contract without Michel's knowledge and sneaking off in the middle of the night. The book just kind of dragged along.	2005-08-31
