Now that I know something, he's not as funny.  It's harder to be funny from the right, or from the top... and in &quot;Peace Kills&quot; it doesn't work so well for me.  Now that I think back, PJ's style could be summed up as &quot;I wonder what the poor people are doing?  Heh heh.&quot;  That angle provided a boost when I was a little twerp, and somehow still thought the left was a dominant threat, and the right-wing an embattled minority.  But time tells me otherwise... so PJ doesn't ring as true (to me) now.  Tip o' the hat to PJ, though, as he still handles his hippie to conserative transition with a cool unseen in so many neocons.  (Say, for example, David - stop foaming - Horowitz!!!).  <br />I first saw PJ on Letterman years ago, and was amazed at how shaken he was.  On more recent TV appearences, PJ is pleasant, if not the confident aggressor/prankster/wisecracker in print.  But, I guess a lot of folks are like that.  I mean, if PJ lost confidence with the right, he'd tell us... or would he?!!  Who knows.  3 stars because PJ is &quot;good people,&quot; injects humor (and often depth!)into world affairs, and he has the Irish gene for good storytelling.	2004-06-21

I have little to add to my fellow Amazon.com reviewers, but I do have an important warning for all Brazilian readers: the Portuguese translation is absolutely horrible. Seriously, it is one of the worst I have ever seen. If you're able to read in English (if you can read this, trust me, your English is good enough), do not buy a copy edited in Brazil - get one from this website instead.

The characters were engaging, the settings were vivid and the story was intense. There were lots of chances for Jack to leave, but he stuck by his ex-wife Rachel's side throughout her coma, meeting her new friends from her new life and caring for the teenage daughters who barely remembered him. One daughter is already coping with the loss of a beloved pet, the other is 'fifteen going on thirty'. Throughout, he finds himself remembering the good times with his ex-wife and decides to rededicate himself to his family, quitting his high-stress job that kept him away from them in the first place. I was moved to tears at several points, something a book rarely does for me. I highly recommend this book.	2004-06-21

But was he deeply insightful? Were his comments so mind-blowing you ever put down the book and uttered: &quot;My God. He's right.&quot; ? Hardly. As tragic as his illness was, Morrie gives us nothing new to think about on the above topics. Love your family. Compromise. Money isn't everything. Such are the words of wisdom handed down through the ages to us; words we often choose to ignore in our personal selfish quests. Morrie hands them down to Mitch, and while they all ring true, how different are they to, say, what my own grandfather told me? What a book of proverbs can tell you? What your local preacher might say Sunday morning? Added to this is an opportunistic biographer who dispensed with his old teacher for 16 years until he popped up on Nightline one night. &quot;Here's my chance,&quot; he thought. Strapping a microphone to the old man's lapel, Mitch even manages to tie up the book deal before Morrie finally moves on to the Great Quip Factory in the Sky. I don't want to sound too down on Morrie, who I am sure was a wonderful soul, but he is one of a million wonderful souls. It's a pity Mitch didn't find a GREAT wonderful soul with stories and anecdotes to make us really think. Even if he had, I doubt his writing would have improved too much. Mitch writes like a sports journalist; a rich gateau of cliches leaving us with nothing to ponder for ourselves. As for the great lie that Mitch has rediscovered himself after his meetings with Morrie, all I can say is that the opportunity Morrie gave him only served to enhance his self-confessed materialistic, career-driven lifestyle. Finally, what is the &quot;great life lesson&quot; we are promised on the cover? Seriously. What is it? Love? Didn't we know that already? The greatest lesson I learnt is that when a book comes as cheap as this one, you get what you pay for.	2004-06-21

One of the century's most interesting characters remains a mystery.<BR>Additionally, this  book could have used a good editor.  Careless spelling mistakes diminish its effectiveness.

I wrote this review hastily....and didn't really give the author the credit I was intending...so I have revised it....<br />I normally avoid modern thriller fiction....especially modern 'you can read this during in-flight service from Boston to D.C.' - and for some reason I keep feeling the need to remind myself why by reading modern thriller fiction.....<br />So here we go. Great Premise! That is what earned my three star rating of the book...just the premise. A journalist finds himself enlisted to a team of scientists who attempt to carbon-date the Shroud of Turin, the burial cloth said to be embossed with the image of Christ. One scientist removes dna samples (via fibers left on the shroud)and uses them to clone Christ....or so it would seem.<br />Flash forward years later, where the hot premise is dropped like a hot potato...and the book becomes little more than the average, dime-a-dozen political/war books...and many do it more effectively. The author is to be commended for going back and revising the book since the original publication to include such incidents as September 11th, the War on Terror, and the slaying of journalist Daniel Pearl....but after finishing the book....it seems like his effort is wasted in trying to put a shiny coating on a permanently dulled floor.<br />The characters are perhaps a bit more interesting than your usual Tom Clancy Rogues gallery, but are lost amidst the nuclear bombs, political maneuvering, and usurping of authority that comprise three quarters of this book.<br />Dull, dull, dull...except for those rare moments when Christopher Goodman, the 'clone' of Christ, displays his 'powers'.  Other than that....the story loses grip on what interested me in the first place. Knowing that it is book one of a trilogy (and now knowing from the author himself that it was originally one large text) and knowing that the author has revised the story since initial publication....perhaps those revisions could have included more evidence of Christopher's powers being put to test/use, and a little more focus on what I assume is intended to be the main focus of the story, a clone of Christ??<br />Sorry to say, but (for me) this only served as a good reminder as to why I usually stick to the classics for a good story....with rare exception. The book is well written, I give it that....but I am a sucker for good in-depth characterization and this story just fails to deliver that for me. I have been encouraged to continue on in the trilogy, by the author, and perhaps some day I might. For anyone interested in a timely topic (cloning) and political/military/war intrigue, this will interest you.	2004-06-21

Lyana the youngest was never favored in court or by his older brothers or sisters and has nothing really to do but try to find those that knew his father a commoner general and then once husband to the queen.

Andrews&quot; novel of recent years to disappoint me more than the De Beers novels did.  And yet &quot;Celeste&quot; left me both angry and sad.  The legacy begun by Virginia Andrews, a truly gifted story-teller has been completely tarnished by Andrew Neiderman.  I fear he has ruined her legacy beyond repair.<br />I honestly thought the first novel in the Gemini series would be Neiderman's redemption.  I thought Virginia's ghostwriter had taken a good look at his previous three mini-series, his De Beers series, and his Broken Wings series, and had decided to try something truly different: make a real effort to produce a piece of literature, not just something to enthrall the masses of tweens that read these stories these days.<br />From my first glimpse of &quot;Celeste's&quot; cover, I was mad.  The phrase &quot;A mother's love as deady as Mommy's in FITA&quot; caught my attention, and kept it.  Andrew Neiderman has not, and will never earn the right to compare *his* V.C. A. writing to what Virginia herself wrote.  <br />(The actual book itself was boring...an interesting concept, but horribly written.)<br />Virginia was a story-teller.  She spun yarns.  Her words...her tone...her plots...they all pulled you into the world she sought to create.  By the end of one of *her* novels, you felt as though you knew each and every character personally.  You rejoiced with their triumphs and ached with their sorrows.  Her stories moved you...or at least, me.<br />No main character after Ruby Landry (aside from Rain Hudson, Brody Randolph, and Melody Logan) moved me.  No series after some parts of the Hudson series, and no mini-series plot or character has ever moved me.  <br />Neiderman's stories try to live up to V.C. Andrews and fall flat.  And his recent stories don't even make that effort.  They are full of stale pop culture references, weak characters, and pathetic, female, idealized leads.<br />In closing, I would like to urge everyone to refrain from reading &quot;Celeste.&quot;  It is not worth your time, and will only continue to tarnish your good memories of the brilliant story-teller Virginia Andrews, and her stories.	2004-06-21

I was not disappointed.  The writer is brutally honest about his own failures in ministry and about the steps needed for leaders (&amp; churches as a whole) to grow and mature in Christ.  I appreciate that he recognizes the need for us to look inside ourselves rather than pooh-poohing that as navel-gazing.  So many of us have no idea why we do what we do; we don't even know what it is we are doing sometimes!<br />The many areas of emotional health the writer addresses are very interesting with good personal examples and suggestions.  The spiritual inventory and the study guide questions would be very useful for personal and group work.<br />1 minor fault I saw:  I thought the categories  in the inventory(emotional child, adolescent, adult) could have been a bit more nuanced; it makes everything less than an &quot;adult&quot; look bad, whereas there is often a lot of growth going on and an emotional &quot;teen&quot; could actually be progressing quite well.  But overall I would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to grow spiritually and emotionally and to engage in more authentic, Christ-like ministry.	2004-06-21

It is well known that he once worked for Christopher Tolkien, but I seem to recall reading that he once worked for Dorothy Dunnett as well, though my memory may have played me false in this.  I know, however, that Kay has stated his admiration for her works and has dedicated a poem to her.  Dorothy Dunnett, author of The Lymond Chronicles and the House of Niccolo series, has been described as the greatest living historical novelist (though she is now deceased).  Her strengths mirror Kay's, as does her most greates weakness: a penchant for melodrama.  In Kay, this was more conspicuous in the Lions of A-Rassan and the Fionovar Tapestry.  The Last Light of the Sun is a bit less lyrical than his previous works, the language more direct, but the writing is still excellent, and the melodrama is kept to a minimum.  The plot moves along with hardly a wasted word.  I disagree strongly with the comments of other reviewers that the numerous side-stories of minor characters were boring.  They added considerably to the feel of the age, the long, dark, muted climb of the Middle Ages back up toward civilization. Guy Gavriel Kay is our greatest living historical fantasist.  All of his books have been excellent.  This is one of his best.	2004-06-21

As the author states himself, the book &quot;...can be used in several ways.&quot;  He divides its uses into 3 categories:  1) a guide to power in general; 2) browsing for a law applicable in one's life; and 3) browsing for entertainment.<br />This culling of 3,000 years of philosophy, literature and wisdom, distilled into 48 &quot;laws&quot;, is a fascinating read all the way through.  The book sites so many historical references and quotes that reading the red notes in the margins of the book is fascinating in itself.<br />I neither advocate nor dismiss these &quot;laws&quot;, but reading about them goes far to explain much that I see in today's cut-throad Corporate world - I see that nothing has changed except the literal bloodshed which has been replaced by the metaphorical bloodshed happening in thousands of boardrooms across the US on a daily basis.<br />If you too are swimming with the sharks, this is a must read!	2004-06-21

I like the fact that Knappe focuses his narrative on his own interests and motivations during the war and not the war aims, troop movements, numbers and battle sequences that the other reviewers can't get enough of.  The photo section included in the paperback edition is made up of Knappe's personal photos taken while on vacation, dating, or in uniform through the years.  His decisions throughout the war are guided by two things; his career path as an army officer and the time he spends with his young wife.  I was fascinated by the twists of fate that kept him moving from place to place attached to different commands.  Clearly, Knappe's war experiences qualified him to write revealing, detailed and highly technical war novels from the German viewpoint.  He chose, however, to fill his novel with the rare human touch of things and people he most valued during the war.  If you remember and like 'Samurai!' by Saburo Sakai, Soldat has a similar tone.	2004-06-21

This goal achieved, pseudo-science will have a firm place in biological instruction, students will receive a wrongful education, and science itself will be maimed.<br />This book should be studied carefully by all who would preserve the integrity of science education in our schools. It will serve as an excellent manual for those called upon to defend the integrity of state courses of study in science against expected assaults by intelligent design advocates in the upcoming, cyclic reviews by state departments of education.	2004-06-21

Mystery author Martin Stillwater has a near-perfect life-he has a beautiful, successful wife named Paige, two young daughters named Charlotte and Emily that are cute as a button, and a flourishing career that is expected to only get better.  One the brink of December and with the holiday season coming soon, Marty sees only brightness in the near future-he is wrong.<br />An unnerving anxiety torments Stillwater, forcing him to believe that he is perhaps going through some psychological trauma.  His fears of psychosis are soon relinquished as a stranger who looks peculiarly similar to Marty invades his home and claims that Stillwater has stolen his identity and life.  The imposter is armed, supremely brawny, and can not be killed.  As the Stillwater family runs for their lives from this look-alike maniac, two agents from a highly secretive government agency is on hot trail of the crazed author charlatan and if they are not successful at stopping him, the Stillwater family and many others could be in grave danger.<br />Another appealing look at how the technological and scientific advances of society can create infinite havoc for the existing world, \\"Mr. Murder\\" touches on many subtle assumptions and suggestions, mainly that novels are the intellectual backbone of entertainment while television and motion pictures only present a fantasy world that is corroding and weakening our civilization.  While Koontz may believe that books are a formidable, if not superior link to pleasurable entertainment compared to the hi-tech media world of today, \\"Mr. Murder\\" is only a middling attempt to prove his beliefs.  The characters are only tolerable and moderately interesting, but Koontz does a fine job of mixing in some humorous dialogue (especially between the cynical agent Drew Oslett and his Trekking rigid partner Carl Klocker) and a few surprises to keep \\"Mr. Murder\\" from becoming a run-of-the-mill thriller.  Not one of his best, but certainly enjoyable enough for fans of Koontz and his witty portrayals of American society that are intertwined with some of the most bizarre suspense plotlines every conceived.	2004-06-21

Picking up this book and reading the first chapter which covers the same period I was astonished by Chadwick's lack of understanding of the events that transpired, when compared to Fisher's analysis. I ended up scribbling corrections in the margins it was so off base. As an example, he reports the oft-quoted myth that the Hessians were drunk that morning when Fisher does a good job of dispelling that misconception. He reports Cornwallis' request to go home (later cancelled by Howe) as a measure of the British confidence and arrogance, when Fisher reports in detail that this decision was based on concern over Cornwallis's wife's health. Fisher makes a good argument that the Howes and Corwallis were actually sympathetic to American claims due to their Whig commonalities but Chadwick misses this concept completely. The list goes on. If you want to read a great analysis of revolutionary war history, read Fisher instead and skip this pap. Chadwick is compelled to add his PhD to the title page and cover... this this should have been a clue that this was a bad investment(...) of $25.	2004-06-21

The first chapter is intensely boring. The second and third chapters seem to have interesting stories that abruptly end.  Of course these small stories (ten in all) are what are supposed to tie the main characters together. But what they mainly serve to do, as the author takes elements from these individual stories, is to create a confusing story that is heavily laced with philosophical thoughts and a limited amount of dry boring dialog. At page 200 I honestly still had not much clue what was going on in this book.  I don't recommend this book to anyone.	2004-06-21

That said, lets get on with the review.<BR>In Camelot's Shadow is a tale about the beautiful and abused Risa, and her adventures as she runs from her family home and evil sorceror Euberacon into the arms of Mr. Perfect, Gawain. These two lovebirds are then forced to fight invading saxons, the seductress, Kerra, and bad guy who confuses everybody in the book with his motivations, Euberacon. Touching story eh?<BR>The plot is mediocre at best: beautiful maiden is in danger and is forced to flee and finds handsome man in process. But it is the writing and Camelot's sweethearts that make this book truly bad. Oh, and the bad guy. <BR>Like most of us, Zettel is able to string a few words togethor into a sentence, and she can even put togethor a decent paragragh. But she seems lost on how to make a decent description. Either Zettel spends pages and pages on everybody's clothing and appearance, describing everything down to the last hem-line, or she begins to compare things to nature. &quot;The door opened like a summer meadow....&quot; and, &quot;Guenevere's body was like a summer sapling...&quot; Gag. <BR>And onto the Mr. and Mrs. Perfect: Gawain and Risa. Both are the epitomy of beauty, intelligence, bravery (that's what the back cover says at least), and wisdom. Now that's nice and all, but all this makes for such boring characters! Every one of their actions is predictable, other than the source of their &quot;wisdom&quot; (Hmmm... Gawain thought as he saw the Green knight enter, He must know where Risa is! I will go after him!). But Gawain is nothing compared to Risa.<BR>Risa is the female protagonist at the book (though I found myself rooting for Euberacon most of the time). She is the ideal female: full of beauty, bravery (will get back to this one in a second), charm, etc. Now back to the bravery thing. In the begining of the book, Risa runs around with her bow hunting. And she takes down a couple Saxons. But the majority of her bravery seems to be running around in tears searching for Gawain in battle. I have never read about a heroine who cries so much. She must be dehydrated.<BR>And onto Euberacon. Euberacon is such a typical bad guy. He is portrayed so completely bad that the reader sympathize with him at all. Being able to understand Darth Vader and Commudus in Gladiator was what made them such succesful bad guys. Euberacon wants to enslave Risa so that he can kill Arthur in order that he might kill EMpress Theadora. Yeah, I don't get it either.<BR>So, if this is the kind of book that appeals to you, go on and press the add to cart button. But if you're looking for a good story, I suggest you look elsewhere.	2004-06-21
US	17899762	R2KWMG34MM9674	0446310786	994527755	To Kill a Mockingbird	Books	5	5	6	false	false	An enlightening and beautifully narrated classic	TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD explores the injustice of racism in the small, sleepy town of Maycomb, Alabama.  Lee's novel is narrated through the eyes of 8 year-old wise-beyond-her-years Scout Finch, a keen and extraordinarily observant child.<br />The horizons of TO KILL... don't end at the explorations and explanations of racism in the South.  Other themes include growing up and emotions involved, how people avoid what they do not understand, and friendships - how they evolve and blossom.  One of Scout's close friends is dimunitive Dill, a \\"Beautiful Child\\" contest winner (a.k.a. Charles Baker Harris) who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt over the summers.  Compelled by mere curiosity, together, he and Scout plot to lure hermit and town bogeyman Boo Radley out into the open.  Peculiar myths and legends surround his very existence, courtesy of the gossip mongers of Maycomb.<br />Lee demonstrates the true ugliness of racism. Racism, we see, is what causes a small Southern town to do a complete turn around.  Scout, with the innocent heart of a child, balances out the misunderstandings.  Atticus Finch, Scout's father, who is always known as \\"Atticus,\\" is chosen to represent a black man who supposedly raped Mayella Ewell, a white farmer's daughter.  This is truly what opens the reader's eyes to the evils of the town.  Despite this, Scout Finch still adamantly believes that people are essentially good overall, \\"once you get to see them.\\"  Obviously, this isn't all true - Scout is mind-blowingly bright yet still exhibits realistic childlike qualities, her naivete being one of them.<br />Atticus can truly be regarded for his extreme heroism.  Despite a cruel and uncaring town, he stood up for what he believed in, what he knew in his heart was right.  He's possesses great wisdom, a heart of gold, great understanding, and considerable kindness.  He treats his children, Jem and Scout, like they are mature adults.  This is probably one of the main reasons why Scout is so keenly and constantly aware of her surroundings, as well as a reason for her innate intellect.  <br />One of the best plot twists in TO KILL... involves a newfound hero that neither Jem and Scout, nor the reader, could have ever predicted would be so brazen and courageous.  Boo Radley is one of the novel's pivotal characters, yet he doesn't appear all that much in the story.  When Scout and company first discuss him and his myths, they speak of him as if he's some kind of hideous monster.  In reality, he is as kind and caring as Atticus and has just as much hero potential, which finally rises to the surface towards the end of the novel for the reader (and Harper's characters) to see.<br />TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is laced with humor, yet it finds a comfortable balance between being both comedic and serious in the subject matter Harper chose to tackle.  It also manages to be sentimental and heartbreaking, yet never even comes close to being borderline mushy and overly sappy.  It's an inspirational tale regarded by generation after generation as a classic - a tale of respect for all human life in a society in which incessant misunderstandings are present within its people.  Look at the world we live in today.  Consider the mindset of various individuals and groups.  I ask you, what person can't relate to this enlightening, eye-opening book?	2004-06-21

Every item was from some obscurely expensive store, or some reference to an author no ordinary person would know. I am gay, but find this kinda of gay writing to represent a very one sided gay life, full of bitchy, vacuous, demeaning comments.  The most important part of the book seems to have been glossed over, the part where Matthew feels up his dad while he is asleep, and from this he feels somewhat responsible for his suicide.  Lots of tired \\"Woody Allenesque\\" dialog and self reflection.  It has all been done before, AND MUCH BETTER. Straight people might like it as it provides a cleaned up version of gay chat lines, but sounds like the musings of a pill popping, name dropping circuit queen trying to validate his lawyerly life of cash cash cash.  <br />And like the other reviewer said about the cover, I too find the cover art boring and trite.

I was skeptical at first, but went into the process with an open mind and heart. The energy shift I experienced during the process and for a long time afterwards was like nothing I have ever felt. The incredible joy and release that accompanied the process is well worth the work to learn. All I can say is, don't knock it until you've really, TRULY tried it. And remember, even if you THINK you're open, if you aren't really, you won't experience a darn thing. That is not Ms. Stein's fault - that is your own. She gave you a divinely inspired tool. Use it. This book is not optional, but mandatory reading (as are all the Energy Balancing books) for personal/spiritual growth and enlightenment. It is probably impossible to describe the beauty of its affects - you really just have to experience it for yourself.	2004-06-21

Dr. Boyd wrote this book in response to many who either wanted to know what he believed regarding Open Theism, or to correct many of the misconceptions people had about what he believed on the subject.  <br />The book presents two motifs found in scripture.  The first are places where the future is presented as determined and settled by God, and the second is where the future appears to be at least partially open and known by God as such.  Dr. Boyd attempts to document the scriptural support for and against Open Theism, and provides his response to each case.  The book is written in layman's terms, and generally tries to keep the discussion on scripture, as opposed to branching off into various philosophic or scientific discussions on the future.  <br />Calvinists will not like Boyd's conclusions, as the many reviews to this book illustrate. People who lean toward the Arminian position, or are a part of the broader expression of the Christian Church, will find much to agree with.  <br />The book is well written, easy to read, and makes its case from scripture.  It may also challenge the reader to take a fresh look at their own position on these issues.  <br />In any case, a healthy scripturally based dialog on difficult theological issues has always been beneficial to the Church in the long run.  In this book, Dr. Boyd seeks to scripturally engage the issues of free will and foreknowledge in positive and respectful way.  <br />The issue is important because, as Dr. Boyd points out, scripture reveals that God seems to allow for possibilities resulting from the free choices of individuals.  It would seem that if we merely write all these cases off as anthropomorphisms, we risk missing the point God is trying to make.	2004-06-21

Prior to Price, historians such as George Stocking have taken an apolitical view of anthropology's history. This is unfortunate in large part because many founding members of the discipline were politically active and engaged. The anthropologists paid a heavy price for this political activism--a point that Price drives home effectively. Encyclopedic in approach, Price does a great job outlining how politically active anthropologists were persecuted and lost their jobs--while the American Anthropology Associaltion looked on and did nothing. Based on extensive research via the FOIA, Price is to be commended for his efforts. While Price has focused on the larger issue of the Cold War, for those who want a case study see William Peace's biography of Leslie A. White. Hopefull the work of Peace and Price will inspire other anthropologists to take a closer look at the history of anthropology. Taken together, Price's and Peace's work will signal a new era in writing about anthropology's past.	2004-06-21

The story picks up promptly as our famous five learn that the essence of Balor is about to be given a physical host in the vast caverns under Edinburgh and only they can prevent it. With the vainglorious Tuatha de'Danaan ever present Church, Ruth, Veitch, Shavi and Laura (whose cynicism and self pity has becoming thoroughly grating) set off with their mentor Tom to stop the Fomorri from releasing their leader into the world.<BR>However, upon arrival in the Scottish capital we find a particularly nasty element of Celtic folklore made incarnate - the Calliach Bheur, pretty much undefeatable and bringer of winter to the land. As this hag moves through the city killing at will to protect the essence of Balor in time for the August 1 ritual, Shavi and Laura manage to defy the Bone Inspector and release the gloriously insane Maponus to do battle with her. Meanwhile, the now lupercini Callow kidnaps Ruth and she ends up in the clutches of Calatin who promptly forces the essence of Balor into her in the form of a Black Pearl. Now pregnant with the dark one, weeks remain until his rebirth, alien-style.<BR>What follows is a race north and south, Veitch and Tom to plead assistance from Tom's once-captor, the Queen of the Danaan, Ruth and Church head to Otherworld to Dian Cecht, Shavi attempts to join with the Bone Inspector to reimprison Maponus and in the interim Church has to deal with the emotional wrangling of Ruth, Laura and Niamh. Eventually, the second denouement occurs with a moment of great sacrifice, two characters die (though you suspect the Pendragon spirit will ensure a resurrection), Balor gets reborn and a host of assorted characters get removed and replaced with new ones.<BR>My only concern with this novel, is the author's continued use of drugs to achieve connection to the spiritual side of the new world. Its over-emphasis is disconcerting attimes and I wonder if it is truly necessary. This aside, whilst not as good as the opener, it serves up enough thrills and spills in an England turned back to magic to ensure the third and final novel is read.	2004-06-21

This is an important book for curious people who dont trust the press and really want some information on this topic.  No they don't have connections with 9/11, but nobody in the Bush admin has purported it EVER.

So, finally, long after its release -- just last week, I read &quot;Waiting with Gabriel&quot;.<br />I wondered at times, if the universe Kuebelbeck described was really the same as the one I live in. Why, I wondered, would someone grasp at the worst possible outcomes when in fact, there are so very many good outcomes? Hmmm, 1999 is when Gabriel lived and died -- perhaps the Kuebelbeck's did not have access to the info that I did in 2001, when we received our in utero diagnosis of HRHS (initially dxed as HLHS). But even with that possible explanation, the fact is, I believe the Kuebelbeck's chose to find the negative at every turn based on what I read in the book. This was apparent not so much in the  info presented in the book, but in the kind of analysis and esp the attitude taken toward kids with hlhs.<br />Here are some examples:<br />Kuebelbeck offers a litany of the various medical/developmental problems that can come with hlhs, some of which include; the need for tube feedings (&quot;almost universal&quot;, she says), no contact sports allowed, poor circulation, and speech development issues.  The problem is that some of the issues Kuebelbeck lists are temporary -- or are not necessarily deep quality of life issues. For example, some kids with hlhs (and other heart problems, too) will need an ng tube -- but not forever. My child came home without an ng tube, and I know of many children with hlhs who never needed an ng tube beyond their first hospital stay. Contact sports? Well, maybe not - but not every child can play contact sports -- is that really enough to say their lives aren't worth living?<br />Kuebelbeck talks about visiting a family who had an infant with hlhs, and how the baby was blue and exhausted after crawling around the floor for a few minutes. Perhaps that baby had only had the Norwood and was ready for the next surgery, the Glenn -- see, it is this type of omission that concerns me -- since that baby may have &quot;looked&quot; much better after the next surgery. Kuebelbeck seems to have labeled that child as having a life not worth living. Again, unfair -- perhaps she should have visited a child post-fontan to make a more well-rounded assessment. <br />There were several instances when Kuebelbeck quoted drs and nurses as saying that if in her shoes, they would not pursue treatment. One nurse congratulated her for not putting Gabriel through the &quot;torture&quot; of the surgeries. Well, I have to wonder how that nurse, in good conscience continues to work in a unit where she feels children are being tortured. I can say that I sat with my daughter through recovery for three open heart surgeries - and while there were distinct moments of discomfort -- there was nothing that I could even remotely describe as torturous. I was there -- I saw it. I would hate for any parents considering surgery to believe that their child would experience &quot;unimaginable&quot; pain, as Kuebelbeck describes it.<br />In our surgical unit, there was a nurse there who had herself been through the fontan, and is devoted to the care of cardiac kids. I don't believe she feels that the children are going through torture. There is a 19 yr old young woman with HLHS who is currently studying at college so that she can enter med school to be a pediatric cardiac nurse. I don't believe she formulates her future as wanting to help torture young children by putting them through heart surgeries. <br />As a Catholic, I was disturbed by the license to do nothing, but I won't criticize the priest involved, since I can't know what information he had or didn't have. I can only say that I hope when he baptizes and confirms children and young folks in his parish who have hlhs and other heart defects that require the very same &quot;torturous&quot; surgeries, that he doesn't believe they have lives that are not worth living.<br />Clearly Gabriel had a lethal case of hlhs -- he did not even live long enough for the interventions that save so many other children. I cried through the rest of the book, particularly when Kuebelbeck describes the day of Gabriel's birth and the time of grief after his death. I so wish that Kuebelbeck would have focused more on these aspects -- those of cherishing Gabriel's life -- instead of trashing the lives of other children with hlhs. I did, however, appreciate her &quot;pro-life&quot; approach to carrying Gabriel.	2004-06-21

A goverment agency that is supposed to uphold the law conspires to frame people so they can become more powerful and to take away freedoms and rights.  They plant evidence, blow up people and say they are bomb makers.  They burn gun stores and say it's anti- gun activists and murder or kidnap people then frame them for crimes.  Who can stop them?  They are the ones who control evidence and do the investigations.  The answer to who can stop them is the common citizen.  This book says the people have power but you must also have courage and resourcefullnes.

It's true that the science here shines more with anecdotal warmth than academic rigour, but it does achieve what Bryson set out to do -- to give the general public some background in certain scienific fields, and more importantly perhaps, to capture their attention with colourful, engaging writing. In no way does it promise scientific depth; as another reviewer pointed out, this is easily seen from the title worded to attract a wider readership, therefore the critcisms of &quot;leave science to the scientists&quot; and &quot;too superficial to be informative&quot; are undeserved. It's like asserting that capitalism has failed because it doesn't promote equality. I think Bryson has introduced non-scientists to paleontology, earth sciences and astronomy in a wonderful way that comes rarely to scientists -- in this way he is a missionary, and the pedants are unhelpfully running on a different vision.	2004-06-21

The book starts by dividing journalistic ethics into political, philosophical, and economic categories, in addition to issues of objectivity and privacy. This is followed by real-life case studies in which reporters and editors had to make tough ethical decisions regarding everything from crime to suicide, AIDS to car accidents, and political scandals to war reporting. The most refreshing aspect of this book is its insistence that none of these ethical crises have clear cut-and-dried answers, and that the process of examination and decision making in the face of such dilemmas is most important, while much can be learned from the experiences of the real-life journalists profiled here. This book impressively covers these very difficult questions. [~doomsdayer520~]	2004-06-21

It is one of JL's first books, and it is obviously a pedestrian effort. The &quot;love&quot; dialogue is beyond cheesy and the love scenes are tepid. Worse, it has a meandering plot that starts with Angela's crush on Bradford as a child (why she likes him, I'll never know), then moves on to a rags-to-riches story with Angela losing all of her Southern white trash talk (which was actually quite charming), to a forced separation based on a rumor of incest that really never seemed to upset Angela other than to make her run away from Bradford. The best part about this book is that it sets up Hank Chavez's story in &quot;Heart of Thunder,&quot; which is a million times better. In fact, only a single year separates the publication of &quot;Glorious Angel&quot; and &quot;Heart of Thunder,&quot; but somehow JL's writing style, sense of character, and dialogue improve tremendously during that short time period. Which makes me suspect that &quot;Glorious Angel&quot; was written long, long before its publication date and published without the benefit of editing, rewriting, etc. That's too bad. &quot;Glorious Angel&quot; could have been much better had JL spent some more time playing up the passion and personalities between Angela and Bradford and less time on fluff like matchmaking in Texas and the pointless assassination attempts on Bradford's life (as an example of how silly this book is, Bradford is tied to a chair in a burning house and his fear of death gives him He-Man strength to break through the ropes, no knife or anything, to escape. Wow!). If you are interested in Wild West romances written by JL, I highly recommend &quot;Heart of Thunder,&quot; &quot;A Heart So Wild,&quot; &quot;Once A Princess,&quot; or &quot;Savage Thunder.&quot; I do not recommend &quot;Glorious Angel&quot; unless you want to read it as a prequel to &quot;Heart of Thunder.&quot;	2004-06-21

American Psycho is highly controversial, and there is no point in avoiding this issue.  However, a book is not to be judged as &quot;excrement&quot; or &quot;inferior&quot; on the basis of the controversy it happens to generate; if this were the case, the Bible, Hobbes' Leviathan, and Plato's Republic could all be considered &quot;excrement&quot; by any number of people.  And yet, any reasoned approach will see the merit (as well as the flaws) of any given piece of literature.<br />I have given American Psycho a five-star rating because it is not controversial for the sake of being controversial.  The novel must be examined in the context of Ellis' other novels, which examine the correlation between amorality and material privilege and what sort of effects this phenomenon has in American society.  In many ways Less Than Zero, Ellis' first novel, is more disturbing than American Psycho, despite the lack of gruesome serial murders and such, yet many of the same critics who look upon American Psycho with derision will find much value in Less Than Zero.  Why is this?  Some have argued that Less Than Zero attempts to demonstrate what might have gone wrong with America's &quot;children&quot;, whereas American Psycho has no project, has no aim, save to disgust and to shock its audience.<br />This assessment is faulty.  The character of Patrick Bateman is not some isolated psychotic created from a void; he is a product of the society in which he lives, our consumerist liberal society, and he is the extreme personification of all of our society's negative traits.  His contempt and disgust for much of the world is not something totally unfamiliar to us &quot;regular&quot; people, as we have felt it from time to time, except perhaps we do not wish to admit it.  The fact that there is a Patrick Bateman &quot;out there&quot; makes us feel more comfortable about the &quot;us, in here&quot;; if HE is bad, then we, in relation to him, are not so bad.  Of course, the dialectic reveals our complicity in Patrick's personality, and we are not so innocent in the final assessment after all.  <br />American Psycho is a powerful and important novel.	2004-06-21

This is a must read for any mother who worked diligently to educate herself and have a career, but gave it all up to be home with her children. Faulkner Fox describes her experiences as a new mom at home with one baby, and later a toddler and a baby, while her husband pursues his interests outside of the house. She tries to understand what her role is now and why, although she completely loves and adores her children, she still feels less than happy.<br />Fox's writing is funny, honest, and sad. Stay-at-home-moms are lucky to be at home, but they also give up their own pursuits and interests. It is a heartbreaking dilemma because the children are only young for such a short period of time. Fox shares her personal experiences as a woman who has given birth to two children, works hard to engage and nurture them, but who also needs enriching experiences in her own adult life.<br />Well-written and engaging.	2004-06-21

Based on the evidence available-including investigation by Czech and U.S. authorities plus detainee reporting-we do not believe that such a meeting occurred. The FBI's investigation places him in Virginia as of April 4, as evidenced by this bank surveillance camera shot of Atta withdrawing $8,000 from his account. Atta was back in Florida by April 11, if not before. Indeed, investigation has established that, on April 6, 9, 10, and 11, Atta's cellular telephone was used numerous times to call Florida phone numbers from cell sites within Florida. We have seen no evidence that Atta ventured overseas again or re-entered the United States before July, when he traveled to Spain and back under his true name.&quot;<br />So all the idiots who say that the Liberal Media debunks this claim without proof, please shut up.<br />The rest of this book is equally awful, and seems to be a compilation of 3 weeks worth of Washington Times Editorials.	2004-06-21

Like those chart reading traders who think they can actually forecast the market direction. Prediction with charts is a losing game. If 100 traders stare at a chart, they come up with 100 different subjective interpretations. This book may actually make them realize that pretending they have unique skill through years of ink blot study is just blowing smoke.<br />Better yet this book is not based off hypothetical testing or experiments in what may work. It uses real performance data from guys who have traded for decades as trend followers. If you worship technical indicators as &quot;it&quot; don't read this book unless you want a hard cold splash of reality. If you worship technical indicators as some market tonic -- go ahead -- but don't forget the best in the business do nothing of the sort.<br />One of my favorite parts is the description of the hundreds of millions of dollars trend followers won at the same time Long Term Capital Management was imploding and losing their shirts. Wow, what an example of risk and volatility in stark terms.<br />But ultimately it is the no holds barred condemnation of fundamental analysis that sticks with me. Trend followers don't waste their time trying to understand forces influencing market participants (fundamental analysis) They care about the market price and what they should do in response to market price movement. Isn't that a goal for all of us? Round of applause for the diligent research and clear writing.	2004-06-21

Apparently unlike author Linda Berdoll, however, I knew that the &quot;wet shirt&quot; version of Mr. Darcy departed from Jane Austen's understanding of her character and his world. <br />This sequel shows no understanding of Darcy and Elizabeth; no understanding of Jane Austen's writing style (I don't believe she ever used the word 'howbeit'); no understanding of the laws of entail (Mr. Bennet's estate could not have been entailed on his sister's son, nor could Lady Catherine have taken possession of Pemberley in the event that Mr. Darcy died without a male heir); and no understanding of a world that was still primarily agricultural, but on the cusp of industrial.  <br />This sequel is a sad representation of Jane Austen's great characters and sullies her reputation as a novelist. If the author  cared to write an early 19th century bodice-ripper, she could at least have changed the names.	2004-06-21

This book provides a script and scenarios for housebreaking your puppy or adult dog.  What I appreciated from this book was an equal amount of devotion to owner's who will paper train or train for the outdoors.  It also takes into consideration owners who must leave dogs alone for long periods as well as owners who have access to their dog all day.  I suggest purchasing a specialized breed book as well, such as a Complete Idiot's Guide..., for additional information about housebreaking your breed.	2004-06-21

They completely turn the standard sequential trilogy/quartet model on its head. The characters are different from book to book. They don't coexist in time. Each is a compelling and brilliantly written stand-alone novel, but.... <BR>When I came to the final novel in the quartet I was awe-struck by Wynne Jones's deft handling of the ideas across the books.

Yes it is and it is high time someone put it in blunt, plain language.<BR>The trouble is the diet industry has been harping on easy loss forever and loves to woo the mentality \\"I lost 15 pounds in one week!\\".

Heifetz was an intensely private man, who did not like to talk about himself and resisted interviews, questions about his personal life, and would-be biographers.  Thus he made the task of anyone attempting a biography of him difficult.  Artur Weschler-Vered in this book took on the intimidating job of writing what claims to be &quot;the first full-length biography.&quot;  It's not without interest, but unfortunately it's not a very good one.  <br />Heifetz gave his own biography as follows:  &quot;Born in Russia, first lesson at three, debut at seven, debut in America at seventeen.  That's all there really is.&quot;  He was a Russian Jew whose father was a violinist evidently determined to turn his son into a great virtuoso.  Heifetz became a celebrated child prodigy in Russia.  He and his family emigrated to the United States in 1917 at the time of the Russian Revolution, and he played a famous, career-launching Carnegie Hall recital in 1917, also the year of his earliest recordings.  He became an American citizen, making his home first in New York City and later in Los Angeles, and continued to concertize and record until 1972, adding teaching to his activities in his later years.  <br />Despite his enormous international fame (RCA Victor billed him as &quot;The Violinist of the Century&quot;), Heifetz was regarded by his detractors as a cold performer, a faultless but soulless virtuoso who played with chilly technical correctness, who took almost everything at a faster tempo than other violinists, and who declined to &quot;emote&quot; during his performances, preferring to play with an impassive expression, the Great Stone Face among violinists.  He was a reserved, difficult man, a legendary perfectionist and what today would becalled a &quot;control freak.&quot;  He had two failed marriages and troubled relationships with his three children, and as he grew older it seems evident that he was increasingly hard to get along with.  <br />Weschler-Vered's book is strongest on the early years and the late years of Heifetz's life, but there are serious lacunae in the middle years, extensive periods of time in Heifetz's prime during which he has little or nothing to report.  Unfortunately these are the very years we would most like to have a full account of.  Occasionally W-V seems to lose focus, as when he digresses at such length about Heifetz's teacher Auer (and other teachers Heifetz had nothing to do with) that the biography threatens to derail.  Since Heifetz made the work of any biographer difficult, it is perhaps not surprising that there is considerable guesswork and speculation here.  But this gets out of hand in the chapter ominously entitled &quot;Personally Speaking:  Mystery,&quot; which attempts to penetrate &quot;the impenetrable mask behind the poker face&quot; of the famous violinist by means of none-too-convincing amateur psychologizing and psychological speculation.  The author also occasionally gets his facts wrong.  For example, he states categorically that Heifetz appeared in only one movie, They Shall Have Music (1938).  But in fact he appeared in a second one, Carnegie Hall (1947), unknown to W-V.  W-V also doesn't seem to grasp that USC (the University of Southern California) and UCLA (the University of California at Los Angeles), with both of which Heifetz became associated in his later years as a pedagogue, are two distinct and separate universities.  <br />W-V is a Romanian Jew, educated in Israel, who writes awkwardly in English.  His prose is wordy, graceless, sometimes unidiomatic, and occasionally ungrammatical; he sometimes chooses what is manifestly the wrong word, and doesn't understand English punctuation well.  He is a writer who needed a good editor, but hedidn't get one, because this book is full of annoying errors that a good editor would have corrected, and shows evidence of never having been proofread (errors in grammar and punctuation, proper names misspelled, etc.).  A sloppy job of preparation for publication by Schirmer Books, the music division of Macmillan, and publisher of many distinguished books on music.  <br />On the other hand W-V is an amateur violinist, and this gives him an advantage in  describing the technique and mechanics of Heifetz's playing.  It should be noted that his attitude toward Heifetz as a violinist is reverential and dismissive of criticism.  <br />The biography per se is 202 pages in length.  The book also includes a useful, comprehensive discography (by Julian Futter, 25 pages) listing all Heifetz's many approved commercial recordings (1917-1972) (no attempt is made to list &quot;pirates&quot; or &quot;off-the-air&quot; issues), two sections of photographs illustrating the violinist's life from childhood to his last concerts, a bibliography, notes, and an index.  <br />In sum, this is far from an ideal biography of Heifetz, but for now it may be the best of a disappointing lot.  Its few competitors all have problems, including a couple of personal memoirs by Heifetz students who knew him only in his last years and which have a self-serving component.  For a Heifetz buff this book is worth owning for the discography alone.  But let's hope that some day soon the great violinist will get the first-rate biography he deserves.	2004-06-21

Some books are dogmatic in their approach, locking the reader into the author's view of analytics.  This one differs by giving readers enough information with examples, clearly articulated factors, and other identified best practices to accept compromise solutions based on budget, level of in-house expertise and other considerations.<br />Another aspect of this book is the way the author cuts through ambiguous terminology that is rampant in the web analytics discipline, which does demystify.  The comprehensive discussion of tools, classified by type, is another area where this book shines. There is too much vendor hype that promotes fear, confusion and doubt, and this book cuts through the hype and uncovers what is and is not important, as well as sets realistic expectations.<br />Using the same comprehensive approach as in other parts of this book, the author covers metrics in great detail. This is, afterall, the essence of web analytics, and the thoroughness and scope of metrics make this book an invaluable resource.<br />If you need to learn web analytics, select tools to support it, or are a practicing web analytics analyst this book is one which should be on your desk - and given to other team members and stakeholders.  It raises the bar in books on the subject and is destined to become a classic.	2004-06-21

The UK poetry scene is smaller than its US counterpart, so the &quot;poetry wars&quot; there must be like a knife fight in a phone booth. I can't understand why co-editor Don Paterson wants to fuel the conflict, as he himself admits that there are some &quot;attractive voices&quot; among the Post-modern camp. Wouldn't it have been more representative to include some of these, rather than the pedestrian Jacky Kay or the dull Andrew Motion?<br />However, the vast majority of the poets in this collection are anything but dull and pedestrian. There's an edgy postmodernity driving the work of John Ash, W.N. Herbert, Peter Didsbury and Jo Shapcott, for instance, and the more formal poets, like Peter Reading and Alice Oswald, are stunning technicians. There's surprisingly little of the &quot;blokey&quot; anti-intellectualism of Larkin and his heirs, though Larkin's masterfully elegiac tone and engagement with the colloquial are detectable in the work of Carol Ann Duffy and Sean O'Brien. I should add that Paterson's own poems are included. After grinding my teeth over his bad tempered factionalism I didn't want to like his poetry, but I found it stunning. <br />This book is required reading for American poetry readers as well as an exciting resource of imaginative possibilities for American poets. Just razor out a few pages of the introduction and stick in a few poems by Denise Riley.	2004-06-21

He attributes most of the conflicts between the Western and modern worlds to differences in views on religion, politics, and social life.  For example, Muslims believe that Muhammad was God's Prophet, who came to bring his final revelations.  Also, they do not recognize Jesus, or any other person, as the Son of God.  Therefore, this causes them to see Christians as \\"infidels,\\" who are ruining the word of God, and vice versa.  Another aspect that Crick points out is the role of religion in government and tolerance of religion.  Many Muslims in the Arabic world see the West as corrupting practicing believers causing them to leave their faith.  In their eyes, the tempter, who causes one to lose belief in Islam, is a greater threat than the Christian or the Jew.  The view of the United States, who brings a liberal culture full of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll, leads certain fundamentalist groups to view it as ruining the Islamic mission of spreading the word to the people of the world.   This causes the backlash that is present in today's terrorism.<br />Crick goes in depth on many of these points.  He also gives a brief summary of the history of the region, and Western actions there.  It is a good read to attempt to understand some of the causes of today's conflicts with terrorism. A word of advice though, it is a difficult read as Crick shows the vocabulary that comes from an Ivy League education.	2004-06-21

Writing in the Summer 2002 issue of Parameters Andrew J. Bacevich observed in a book review \\"This is a book on considerable wisdom, larded with considerable nonsense. \\"  The same criticism could be lodged against American Empire.<BR>  This book is part of a group of volumes in recent years, like Chalmers Johnson's Blowback and Samuel Huntington's Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order which suggest that we should reevaluate the history of American foreign policy, pushing aside idealistic self-delusion and recognizing that a continuing driving need to open new markets abroad and forcing the international community to conform to policies of economic liberalism which make the world safe for American business interests.  What differentiates this crop of criticism from that which came before is that is comes not from the traditional academic left, but from former cold-warriors and thinkers more closely associated with the political right.<BR>Bacevich starts by reviewing the careers and theories of two diplomatic historians, Charles Beard and William Appleman Williams.  Both theorists viewed U.S. foreign policy through an economic lens, tracing the source of American actions abroad to conditions at home.  The both are in line with Bacevich in attacking the view of the United States as a \\"reluctant superpower.\\"  On Page 24 he quotes Beard \\"Empires are not built in fits of absent mindedness.\\"  The author acknowledge that both these individuals were largely discredited late in their carreers for failing to see the hostile ideology of the day as any kind of threat.  Beard dismissed the rise of European Fascism, while Williams similarly ignored international communism.  This is ironic for while Bacevich, with the advantage of hindsight, acknowledges Nazi and Stalinist/Maoist regimes as legitimate threat worthy of U.S. military intervention, he seems dismissive of the rising threat of violent religious fundamentalism.<BR>After this section comes the highpoint ofthe book, an intriguing if slanted history of U.S. foreign policy of the post Cold War era.  Working primarily from news reports, speeches and public documents, the author compiles an intriguing analysis of the events of the two Bush and Clinton administrations.  While focusing on the last 14 years, he also tries to connect the actions to long-term trends in U.S. diplomacy dating back to at least the Spanish American War.  Unfortunately this ambitious work of historical analysis is underplayed in favor of a survey of more recent events.<BR>  The usefulness of this portion as a reference is compromised by the fact that the events described are not ranged chronologically, but rather the author seems to be trying to group the material by theme in chapters titled \\"Globization and its Conceits\\" and \\"Policy by Default\\" among others.  These themes are so repetitive however that that it is hard to pick out just what point a particular incident is supposed to evidence. <BR>  After this comes a series of out of place digressions on a variety of topics.  Other readers have noted that the book at time reads more like a selection of separate essays tenuously connect rather than a unitary, flowing argument.<BR> The chapter \\"Gunboats and Gurkas\\" discussing the reluctance of the U.S. to commit forces and its tendency to fight conflict either by proxy or through high-technology.  This is followed directly by \\"Rise of the Proconsuls\\" which suggest that we as citizens should be wary of the foreign policy power invested in American military elites.  \\"Proconsuls\\" is interesting in that a large portion of the chapter is devoted to GEN Wesley Clark's behavior in the NATO-Serbian war, with the material derived predominantly from Clark's own book.  Despite the source,  the text does not display the General in a positive light.<BR>  With the bulk of it appearing to have been written prior to the tragedy of September 11, 2001, the observations in this book about the Bush administration's foreign policy in regards to the Mid-east have not aged well.  The Author makes reference to the war in Afghanistan; however he seems to feel that the events of that conflict did not signal a fundamental change in US foreign policy practice, or the alleged reluctance of America to commitment ground forces.  The current occupation of Iraq makes some of his statement almost comical.  For example:  He suggests you can rate the administration commitment to the current conflict by the number of reserve component soldiers called up, stating \\"The president ordered modest numbers of national guardsmen to active duty-far less than in 1990-but most citizen-soldiers called to the colors were assigned duties no more hazardous than providing backup security inside airport terminals.\\"  With tens of thousands of Nation Guardsmen currently deployed around the world and 88 dead in Operation Iraqi Freedom alone, this line seems both flippant and naive.   \\"(The Bush Team) made no preparations to take the fight to the Taliban...U.S. forces in (as opposed to above) Afghanistan was confined to a single raid by about a hundred Army Rangers, as inconsequential as it was brief.\\"  In light of subsequent events, one can only conclude that Dr. Bacevich severely misread the intentions of the Bush administration.<BR>Interestingly, the sentence above is included verbatim in a National Review article Mr. Bacevich wrote nearly a year earlier.    That piece made most of the same points as the \\"War for Imperium\\" chapter, in about the same number of pages. This would seem to lend credence to the theory that this piece was assembled out of previously existing essays or at least that he was mining the his existing works for material to flesh out the book.<BR>  Despite the merits of offering a diplomatic history of the post cold war era, American Empire as a whole is a largely unsatisfying work.  The author's core thesis, while not irrefutable, is one worthy of further research and discussion, Overall, Bacevich offers a good attempt at contemporary diplomatic history and analysis and then sabotages it with a dearth of unnecessary and off topic material.	2004-06-21

As a pastor, this work ranks among the top works I have read in understanding the gospel, the work of the Holy Spirit, the nature of genuine salvation.  There are three major parts to this work.  The first section Edwards defines what a religious affection is and how it is different from what he calls animal affections.  This distinction is both necessary for understanding his work, but also is a helplful tonic for insight into today's religious movments and modern worship experiences.  In the second section, Edwards develop 12 marks that do not argue for or against the work of the Spirit.  The Great Awakening had many excesses and abuses which Edwards neither support the event nor do they necessarilly take away from it.  What is interesting about this section is that Edwards is saying that these marks ultimately mean nothing.  Yet, most of what is found here is the basis of much of today's evangelical church.  In my first reading I kept finding myself saying but this is what I was taught to be Biblical Christianity.  Edwards was saying if you have this experience or don't have this experience means is not proof one way or the other about your conversion.  In the third section Edwards develops the 12 marks that are truly evidences of the working of the Holy Spirit.  This section is extremly helpful for the modern minister.  With great care and lengthy development of thought, Edwards walks you through the marks of genuine conversion.<br />Edwards is hard to read for those who are just getting started with him.  However, the more you read the easier he becomes.  Don't give up too soon - you will get back 10 fold for all the effort you put in.  The particular edition you are reading about is easy on the pocket book.  If you have limited funds, it is a good way to get started.  However, if you are serious about reading Edwards, don't forget to checkout the Yale editions.  They are very expensive, but the foot notes, extensive introductions, and indexs are worth the extra money.	2004-06-21

This was dumb and they sounded like some very out of date 70 year olds TRYING to appeal to younger audiences but deparately failing.  They sounded more like very conservative religous scholars who have become paranoid over the success of a novel . . fictous novel by the way . . . <br />The authors were trying to claim that Da Vinci code is going to lead to drugs and sex, and Brown has hidden intentions of his book leading to a cult . . at least that is what I kept picking up.  And leading good Christians astray from their beliefs.  Well, if a Christian walks away from his/her beliefs from a fictionary novel, then they were not very strong Christians in the first place.<br />This book was so poorly written, I kept finding myself laughing out loud in parts and being completely puzzled as to the points the authors were trying to make.  It almost made it a good read because it was so off the mark!<br />I thought Da Vinci Code was a great novel and would have loved to have read a book objectively addressing some religous issues used in the storyline.  This book is neither!  It doesn't well agrue any bibical agruement, but rather makes a rather open statement then moves on.  I felt there was no research at all going into this Cracking the Da Vinci code.  How two 'scholars' could put a book out there with such lame research and a dumb Carrie storyline is beyond me! <br />Don't waste your time or money on this one.  If you want an objective book, look through some of the others that are popping up and read those reviews.  Hopefully someone will have a good one to offer the curious mind!	2004-06-21

It not only gave faces to the names, but it was a joy to see how wonderful they are as a family.  Dr. Florance's book has helped our family understand another way of looking at how our brain functions. This book is not a tutorial, however it is a window for some autistics who you know can understand everything that is said to them and can communicate in their minds, just not through their voice. My husband is a neurosurgeon who has a lifetime of not understanding how his brain worked \\"differently\\" from others, our 5 year old is gifted and absolutely a visual learner, and our 4 year old son has been diagnosed with autism and PDD since he was 2 years old. After months of different therapy that seemed to just to be going through the motions, one of our therapist brought us this book and it was like turning a light bulb on. Our son, so much like Florance's, can run a computer, a dvd player, and appears to understand everything said to him, yet cannot form correct speech. This book is for those who want to learn how their child's brain is working and then how to possibly find ways to \\"re-wire\\" or concentrate on areas to eventually bring those \\"pictures\\" to words. I would highly recommend this book for those who enjoy a heart-warming story of a mother's \\"gut instinct\\" and determination; and also for those who are looking at another way to understand how some highly visual learners and some autistics are \\"wired\\" differently.	2004-06-21

In short, it seems many succumbed to the peer pressure that it was a \\"great\\" book and that they just \\"had\\" to read it.  It puts me in mind of someone going to an art gallery full of atrocious modern art and faking that they liked it to show how sophisticated they are.  The truth is this book stinks.<br />For one thing it is vulgar, which, I hate to disappoint anyone, requires no talent at all.  This is a talent any six year-old boy possesses.

This is due more to a prurient self-interest in Japanese mythology, South East Asia, hot Asian women, sex and sake than it is to anything like character and plot.  The novel doesn't end, but rather poops out.  As a platform for Tom's philosophical whimsy, it offers little he hasn't already said, though I agree with him whole-heartedly.  If you're already a fan, read it for Tom's characteristic bubbling prose.  Newcomers should start with Skinny Legs, Jitterbug, or Still Life and go from there. Frankly, Tom lost his edge with Frog Pajamas and has been sliding down the slippery slope ever since.	2004-06-21

Ayn Rand was a woman who, at her best, believed fiercely in the near supernatural worth of the human animal. I cannot and will not argue with her on this idea, as I do not completely disagree with her. However, my comment on this novel revolves around her attempt in this novel to describe the various elements extant in the world which she believes work to destroy this near-godly spirit embedded in the persona of modern man.<br />&quot;Atlas&quot; is not a work for the fence sitter. Reading it will make all but the most stubborn minds take one opinion or the other about her viewpoint. This polarizing effect makes many people hate the book, and it made me want to hurl it at the wall several times. Frequently, I found her view, which describes the Objectivist philosophy, destructive and unrealistic. To be honest, when you consider man to be a demi-god whose purpose in life to destroy the elements of life that try to crush him, it is nearly impossible to write a book that is either realistic or that will appeal to all who read it.<br />At best, Objectivism scores its best points in its economic statements. The way it is presented, it certainly makes sense that the primary goal of industry should be to make money, and the public good be damned. For what other purpose should industry exist than for the building of wealth? From the viewpoint of this novel and from other sources on Objectivism, it makes as much sense to suggest that businesses look out for the public good as it does to insist that charitable organizations should exist to make money.<br />In the end, I do not agree with Objectivist philosophy, but that does not mean I do not admire this book. To be sure, this story is pure fantasy, and those that would endeavor to follow its example are, in my opinion, foolhardy, but this novel exists as an exhilarating work. Sure, the characterizations are wooden and one-dimensional, but I dare anyone to read Rand's elegant prose and resist getting swept up in it at least once or twice.	2004-06-21
US	41441691	ROB5LN4YKT98Y	0689318618	946991350	America the Beautiful	Books	4	4	6	false	false	Review by Livingston Parent Journal	Samuel Ward (1847-1903) was the organist at  Grace Episcopal Church in Newark in 1882.  One day a melody popped into his head as he was riding the boat back from Coney Island.  He called it \\"Materna\\" and it was first published in 1888.<br />Katharine Lee Bates (1859-1929) was an English professor at Wellesley College in Massachusetts.  In 1893 she made a trip by train to Colorado.  From the to of Pikes Peak she saw the Rocky Mountains in one direction and the Great Plains in the other, and she felt inspired to write about the beauty of America.  Her poem was published in the Fourth of July issue of The Congregationalist in 1895.  Her poem was popularly sung to Ward's tune, and they were first published together in 1910.(...)<br />Later in the 1900s Neil Waldman was staying at a kibbutz in Israel.  His friend  Moti Shuvai insisted that they take a road trip together through America.  They traveled from New York through the Northern Rockies, down along the Pacific Coast, back through the Southwest and the South to New York, 13,000 miles.  Waldman combines his sixteen paintings, \\"a visual record of that first cross-country trip\\", with the words to \\"America the Beautiful\\", written by Katharine Lee Bates, to make a children's book that celebrates the scenic glory of America.  \\"...it should inspire readers with a desire to see these wonders for themselves.\\"(School Library Journal) <br />In the foreword he says this, \\"...I have traveled to four continents and more than a score of countries, but nothing I have seen can match the magnificent splendor that lies within our own borders.\\"<br />Parents will have a chance to tell about when they have visited these places,  or make plans with their children to do so, because an appendix describes all of the places featured in the paintings.  They include Niagara Falls, The Great Smoky Mountains, The Grand Canyon and the California Redwoods.  Families also could talk about the beautiful places in Michigan or even Livingston County that Bates and Waldman unfortunately never had a chance to see.  Or other places you have visited that are not included like Florida, Alaska, or Hawaii. <br />This book also helps to make art and poetry accessible to children of all ages, and each child can relate to it in his own way.  The folks at Publishers Weekly relate to it like this:  \\"...he renders each vista in thick, impressionistic strokes from a predominantly violet palette, choosing his colors as if from a paradigmatic sunset.\\"  (If that helps you at all.)  <br />Also included are all four stanzas and sheet music.	2004-06-21

They're both entertaining books, but also ones that are a bit elementary for the class.  I would say they are written for entertainment first, enlightenment second.  Flatterland is NOT the same type of book.  I have never been an Ian Stewart fan, but I do like this book.  While the first two books are easy enough for a 7th grade student to understand, the topics in this book will require most high school students to be walked through the material.  It's not an easy read.  I will use this book with some of my students in the future, but only those that enjoy a challenge.  It's true that the book tries to cover too much, but I think you should view it as a survey of modern mathematics.  In my opinion, this is some of the best writing I've seen from Stewart, but definitely not up to the literary level set by Flatland and Sphereland.	2004-06-21

It's rare for a secondary source to clarify the meaning of a primary source, but Marsden does just that. For instance, Edwards' \\"Religious Affections,\\" quoted by so many modern evangelicals, is understood by so few. Marsden captures the culture and context that motivated \\"Religious Affections\\" and thus explains its meaning and potential applications today.<br /><br />Though long, Marsden's style is lively; he rarely says more than is necessary. Perhaps the sheer length is why a few typographical errors remain in this first edition. That aside, Marsden has written what will be the classic Edwards text for decades. If you are a student of early American history, even if you care little for Edwards or the Puritans, \\"A Life\\" will enlighten you to shaping factors often overlooked in other American history texts.<br /><br />Reviewer: Dr. Robert W.

She buys a wig with dark brown mid-legnth hair to hide her beautiful long red hair, and some large fake coke-bottle glasses to disguise her beautiful face, and some drab clothes that hide her figure (as far-fetched as this is, I actually no someone who did something similar to this, and it did work). It works and nobody recognizes her, she calls herself \\"Ella Sanders\\", and starts attending the local high school. She meets a nice normal guy named Dave and they hit it off.<br /><br />  Just a few years ago there was a TV movie with Justin Timberlake and Maggie Lawson based off of this book. It was also titled \\"Model Behavior\\", but its not as good as the novel, and the TV film was more of a new version of \\"The Prince and the Pauper\\" than an adaptation of this book, and not a very good one at that.  The book deals with some of the same issues such as finding yourself, but it is about far more than that.<br /><br />  I guess Jaqueline isn't the most interesting female lead, but the male characters are fun, and the romance is nicely written, its a fun, fluffy, and funny book. The book is trying to say that models are just like you and me, no matter how aloof and far off they may seem. While we all know that, it is something we often forget, especially as teens, we seem to see models as something we should strive to look like, if they were treated as normal people, then we probably would stop looking at them, which the book does show. Regardless of its intended message, it is  a fun and nostalgic quick read for teenagers. Highly enjoyable.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy	2004-06-21

I wanted to build a rowing/sailing craft that would be relatively stable in weather.  I read Gardner's book cover to cover, decided that there was enough detailed information to guide a first-time boat builder through the construction of almost any of the boats described, and started building the Dion Swampscott dory in my basement that December.  With the book open on my work bench, I slowly turned a pile of oak and northern white pine lumber into a 17' dory that has served me well in a variety of settings, from Lake Champlain to Penobscot Bay to the waters off Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.  My only regret is that I never got to take John Gardner's boat building course at Mystic Seaport.

This is the 16th sequel to that book and as much as I hate to say so, this &quot;dog&quot; doesn't hunt very well. The premise of the story requires a suspension of belief - Russia has been taken over by a crazed general who launches a pre-emptive strike against the US using bombers and missiles which knock out most of our strike capability in the western half of the US. Patrick McClanahan, the Peck's bad boy of the USAF has been demoted to an intelligence role and even there deduces the liklihood of the attack, only to be rebuffed by the higher ups who hold him responsible for all of the stuff that has happended in the previous 15 novels which have raised holy hell all over the world. <br />Brown is suffering from Clancyitus in much of the book as he describes weapoms systems and procedures to an extent which is not necessary to appreciate the story. I'll admit that once McClanahan takes his Battle Mountain group to Russia to revenge the attack and make things right that it at least gets a bit more upbeat, but it is all fairly predictable and the end of the book suggests that this is not the end of the series. It was a great ride for a long time, but it is time to put the Old Dog story in the hanger, in my humble opinion.	2004-06-21

Jonas's assignment, however, sets him apart from his peers, and ultimately from the whole community.<br />He is selected as the next Receiver of Memories, a post that allows him access to knowledge of the past carefully guarded from all but one Receiver in each generation. His lot will be to bear the pain of bearing, not only in his mind and imagination, but in his body, feelings and sensations suppressed in others by lifelong administration of biochemical regulators.<br />Besides the old Receiver of Memories, whom Jonas calls The Giver, he becomes the only one able to see colors, feel pain, desire, loss, hunger, and to remember a world in which people felt something deeper than superficial stirrings. Among other things, he discovers what it is to feel love. Horrified at the blankness in which his people live, he chooses, with the Giver's blessing, and at great risk, to escape the community, and thus to release into it the memories he will not keep to himself.<br />Rescuing a child destined for \\"release\\" for nonstandard development, Jonas embarks on a journey that leads him to a faraway place where the old life survives, leaving behind him a community that will emerge from their anaesthetized condition into the costly terms on which the gifts of ecstasy, joy, awareness, grief, and pain give life its value.	2004-06-21

The author discusses the U.S. effort to overthrow Congo's leader Patrice Lumumba in 1960, because he was too independent. The West wouldn't help him suppress a rebellion in Katanga province sponsored by Belgian mining interests, so Lumumba turned to the Soviet Union for aid. The U.S then had an excuse to get rid of him.   Mamdani  shows how the mercenaries the U.S. used to crush a Lumumbaist rebellion in Kivu province in 1964-65 committed horrible atrocities.. Then Lumumba's killer General Mobutu seized power and ravaged and looted the country with Western aid. <br />The author notes that the U.S. and South African backed rebels in Angola,UNITA, were cited by Africas Watch as being behind the planting of the landmines that made Angola one of the amputee capitals of the world, laying siege to villages to starve civilians, kidnapping, and so on. This was another example of the U.S. opposing \\"ultra-nationalist regimes\\" that had to turn to the Cubans for aid. He shows how the U.S. encouraging of South Africa 's aggression against its neighbors undermined moderate tendencies in it and set back the end of apartheid. A State Department report concluded that the South African backed Renamo guerillas, which was supported by Bob Dole and the Heritage Foundation., were responsible for 95 percent of the atrocities in Mozambique's barbaric civil war. South Africa heavily invested in the U.S. media and Jerry Falwell.<br />He discusses the libertarian tradition of Islam, i that allows for a participatory democratic and modernized \\"Itjihad\\" to interpret Sharia law. He shows how little jihad as \\"holy war\\" was part of the Islamic tradition before the Afghan war. <br /> He notes the U.S. began aiding the Mujahadeen at least six months before the Russians invaded.  In March 1985, the immortal Reagan compared them, the  Mujahadeen, to our  founding fathers.. The CIA approved the Saudi selection of Bin Laden as leader of the \\"Arab Afghans\\" and gave him the contract to build the Khost tunnel  complex. Training of trainers for Pakistan's mujahadeen camps took place in many bases in the U.S. The majority of U.S. aid went not to the most viable political and military Afghan groups but to Gullubdin Heckmatyar's Hizb-e-Islami.. Heckmatyar had during his younger days led mobs in throwing acid in the faces of women not wearing the veil. The CIA liked Heckmatyar's warriors because they were the most brutal. Pakistan's dictator General Zia and its ISI  gave him control of Afghan refugee camps in Pakistan and he ruled them with murder and violence.  He operated heroin factories just inside Pakistan, in Southern Helmand,. In 1988-89, Heckmatyar' and another Mujahadeen leader who enjoyed castrating landowners who refused to grow opium for him, fought the largest battle of the whole anti-Soviet war not against the Russians but each other for control of the opium growing and heroin processing business in the Helmand valley.  Afghan war related CIA assets like Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman and Ramzi Yousef went on to many infamies including the WTC bombing in 1993 (he notes the trouble that an FBI regional director got into for pointing this out). The CIA sponsored recruitment tours of the U.S. conducted by Sheikh Abdul Azzam, a founder of Hamas and Al Qaida. Today Pakistan produces 75 percent of the world's heroin., whereas before 1979 it produced almost none.The DEA was instructed to ignore Pakistan's facilitation of  the Mujahadeen heroin trade. The CIA Afghan operations head later said that the CIA should have to apologize for all this. The author should have noted that U.S. forces have recently been trying to assassinate Heckmatyar.  The author goes over the previous CIA facilitation of the drug trade in France, Burma and Laos. <br />The CIA worked with military officers from the fascist regime in Argentina and Israel in order to support the Contras in their early years, which were made up of right wing politicians and military officers formerly allied with the barbarian dictator Somoza, as even some U.S. funded Contra leaders like Arturo Cruz began to complain. Israel as proxy for the U.S. had supplied Somoza with 98 percent of his weapon in the last horrific months of his rule. Former CIA analyst David MCMichael testified that the U.S. hoped by Contra terror to provoke the Sandanistas  to various atrocities to get ammunition to use against them.<br /> Mamdani quotes Oliver North's notebook and the infamous 1985 CIA training manual about how U.S. backed Contra terror hoped to destroy Nicaragua's economy and make the people of the country loose faith in the ability of the Sandinistas to provide security. The Notebook also quoted reports by North's aide Robert Owen of drug running by Contra leaders.  The biggest evidence is provided by the 1998 report of CIA Inspector General Frederick Hitz. Despite Hitz's denials to the contrary the fine print of Volume 2 of the report revealed the CIA had worked with 58 drug running Contra officials and allied with the powerful Caribbean drug lord, Alan Hyde. The report also revealed that CIA director William Casey had made a deal in 1982 with the Justice Dept.  that allowed the CIA not to report any drug dealings by its non-official employees. <br />He points out how the U.S. deliberately destroyed Iraq's infrastructure necessary for the maintenance of civilian life during Gulf War I, a war crime, then blocked Iraqi repairs of such things as water treatment plants on ridiculous grounds, causing horrible epidemics. It's use of depleted uranium weapons in 91' and 03 has killed hundreds of thousands of children and infected U.S. troops with \\"the Gulf War Syndrome.\\" The U.S., after Rumsfeld's 1983-84 visits with Saddam, massively helped Saddam get materials for his WMD arsenal, and protected his gassing of Kurds from UN scrutiny. The U.S. then kept Saddam in power after Gulf War I, as the author quotes Thomas Friedman of the NYT. He notes the Shendon PR firm, the facilitators of the bogus babyincubator story back in 1990 was placed on contract in early 2002 by Rumsfeld's OSI.	2004-06-21

When I first started into magic full time, this was one of the books that I read and re-read thoroughly. It gave me real insight into how to create a consistent character and how to THINK about magic when I was doing magic.<br />I fully believe that most people who have purchased this book have never read it. If they had, there would be more really excellent magicians in the world. But you can tell the ones who have read it and who understand it, because their magic is consistent, convincing and natural.<br />If you want to do good magic, buy this book and read it. It will tell you how to think, speak and act when you are performing. And it will give you some material that is not too difficult, but has very great impact upon an audience. And don't worry about performing that material in front of someone else who has purchased this book. He probably hasn't read it anyway!

The space between truth and fiction is bridged through the elements of design and his images are visually pleasing.  His nudes define femininity. They are ideal for the male gaze which captures the essence of the female form through erotic eyes.  It is evident that Man Ray knew the rules therefore he could break them.

It said this novel was famous because of Hemingway's prose, and I agree. He does not dress up this story with unfathomable metaphors and whatnot. He tells it like it is, which is what I like. This is the &quot;Lost Generation&quot; - the people right after World War I, and everyone's pretty much...lost. Our characters capture that theme very well, with their decadence (heavy drinking) and meandering. The characters Lady Brett Ashley and Jake Barnes are memorable. They both love each other very much, but Jake is impotent due to a war injury, and this prevents Brett from committing to him. This is a poignant novel, and sometimes, I could relate to their issues (minus the heavy drinking!) very well.	2004-06-21

However, this book is screaming for a final editor, someone besides its author.  It has enough typographical errors to be distracting. It sets a world record for the use of colons and dashes, marks that are useful only when used sparingly.  (After reading this book, my eyes were red after being zapped by so many of these usually underused marks.)  Finally, the author reveals that he has little ear for idioms.  For example, in his &quot;after&quot; passages used to illustate how passages can be corrected, he often uses the phrase &quot;Still and all.&quot;  I have never, ever read that phrase in print or heard it spoken.  At first I thought the phrase was another typo, but after I ran across it a few times I knew that it was not.  I can only assume that this book would have benefitted from a second set of eyes reviewing it before publication.	2004-06-21

I have a special attachment to this book, since it was given as gift to my mother when she was pregnant with me, and I grew up reading the short paragraph-length stories contained within it. <BR>There is a great deal of fodder for nightmares here and the art work in this book is especially haunting. Heinz Edelmann's drawings are far from simplistic, his imagery is dark and unsettling in an indescribable way. His gnarly, tortured lines are reminiscent of Alfred Kubin or Gunter Brus.  <BR>Also, consider this: the little people here are portrayed as imperfect and cruel and most of the little tales are about child murder, rape, decapitation, murder of pregnant women, greed, lust, senseless evil, and so on, written in a sober and almost detached manner.

Daniel Gardner's translation accomplishes the latter. The sayings of the Taoist sage are clear and compelling, assisted with metaphoric examples while not being burdened down by poetics.<br />The book is a meditation on the development of moral character. From beginning to end, Chu emphasizes the importance of education and study to the development of ethical principles. While he begins with a gloss on early education methods, he does not go where so many philosophers of education have: straight to a discussion of pedagogical method. Instead he merely says of teachers that they instruct a student in the beginning and correct him in the end, but that the responsibility of learning is on the student.<br />This responsibility underscores Chu's main recurrent theme in this text, the proper development of moral principle. While he writes much about the proper method of education, his most important discussion is of the proper motives for study. He laments (in complaints as relevent today as they were in the twelfth century) that people read only to impress others and to get ahead politically, not for the personal edification that learning brings.<br />The only drawback to this text is Gardner's commentary. The footnotes are helpful with tricky translations, but the embedded commentaries are distracting and border on arrogant. Rather than letting the reader decide the meaning of a text for himself (in the vein perhaps of a Buddhist koan), Gardner sometimes interjects that the meaning of a passage is unclear. Perhaps he ignored Chu Hsi advising to abandon preconceptions when reading. Normally one could well ignore distracting commenatry, but in this text it is not typographically distinct enough to be distinguished with ease.<br />This is a good text even for non-Taoists and those totally unfamiliar with the Way. It is a solid meditation on proper self-education and personal development for its own sake.	2004-06-21

Normally I won't read a book that has more than two or three viewpoint characters.  This book had more than a dozen narrators, but such is McCrumb's talent that each character has a unique voice and point of view so you aren't jarred by the transitions.  <br />There is no mystery in here per se, though the book is shelved in the mystery section. And the action switches between past and present, tracing one family through the generations while events in the present unfold over the course of a few days.  <br />The real star of this book is the Appalachin setting, which McCrumb writes about lovingly but without sentimentality.  Every time I read one of her books I feel as if I had spent that time in her beloved mountains, meeting some of the wonderful and quirky characters who fill her stories.<br />A great read.  It's a treat to watch how McCrumb continues to grow as a writer in each of her books.	2004-06-21

Paragraphs are given for each show and can be found in chronological order of their opening nights.  Revivals are also discussed on their opening nights.<br />Despite the repetitive setup of the book's information, Bordman is able for the most part to write entertaining yet dense descriptions of the show's plot, hit songs, message, and overall run.  Although he spends more time on Musical Theatre's great hits (the biggest hits get a full page or two), some of Bordman's best writing moments come during his descriptions of some of Broadway's awful flops.<br />Other reviewers of this book criticize that Bordman has less to say about musicals since 1960.  I find this also to be true in some respects.  In Bordman's defense, this is in part due to the decline in Broadway's quality in the 1970s and 80s.  Bordman clearly comes from the camp of critics who feel that The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas and Cats, while popular, are not as artistically relevant as Oklahoma! and Show Boat.  Bordman is also no fanatic of Sondheim, as well, although he recognizes his lyric-writing genius.  For these reasons, the book gets four stars.<br />Having read the entire book, however, I must say that I know a lot more about American Musical Theatre than I did before, and probably know more by reading this book than by reading any other.  For libraries this book is a MUST have.  It's not cheap, but neither is any other 900-page hardcover book.  If you are looking for the ultimate reference on American Musical Theatre, this is it.	2004-06-21

But of all his works, this one was the book he hoped would be read by subsequent generations.  The message of the book really boils down to this - who saves whom.  For Luther, salvation was all about what God did to save sinners who can not even prepare themselves to receive saving grace.  In this work Luther is interacting with Erasmus, a Roman Catholic Humanist (in the good sense of that word) who also wanted reformation of the church.  However, while Luther's reformation focused on the gospel and how a sinner is saved, Erasmus' view was more about moral improvement and abuses in the church.  To the modern reader, Luther might sound harsh and mean spirited.  However, he was writing in a tone that was part of that day.  So don't get turned-off by the language and look to the argument.  There is much for us to learn today by this great master of the past!  Sola Fide!!	2004-06-21
US	52615285	R3FZKN1PKWL0AB	0609608444	517121775	The Devil in the White City:  Murder, Magic, and Madness at the Fair That Changed America	Books	5	3	4	false	false	A Fascinating Popular History	This highly readable book intertwines two separate stories-- the creation of the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 and mass murderer H. H. Holmes - into a splendidly readable story.  The blurb on the jacket lauds author Erik Larson's novelistic ear and eye, and for once, that praise is richly deserved.<br />The focus of the book is on the Fair, how Chicago competed to win the prize, and how Daniel Burnham, an architect and city planner, overcame great obstacles to build and manage this magnificent spectacle.  As with any large and complicated undertaking, Burnham, who emerges as the driving force, had to battle the egos of his fellow architects charged with building the massive series that comprised the Fair, the government bureaucrats who wrestled for control of the exhibits, and the anxious businessmen who were concerned until almost the last minute that the Fair would be a financial flop.  As he tells Burnham's story, we also get wonderful portraits of the other leading architects of the day, and their uneasy collaboration and rivalry with Burnham.<br />Larson's book is also very much about the maturation of Chicago, and how the Fair became a symbol of Chicago's effort to assert itself as a top-tier US and international city. Along the way, Erik Larson teaches us about the historical growth of Chicago, its famed stockyards, its massive inferiority complex toward New York, how mass migration was affecting the rights and lives of young women, social life in late 19th century Chicago, and Frederick Law Olmsted's theories of landscape architecture.  If that sounds like a wide-ranging ramble, it is, but to Larson's credit, the trip is an interesting one.  The book reads quite quickly: I read it over a weekend.<br />And Larson does a great job in conveying just what a spectacle the Fair was.  As is well known, the Fair introduced the Ferris Wheel, now a staple of carnivals and amusement parks around the world. And it's easy to forget, in this day of the Internet and all-pervasive media, that as recently as 1893, many people in rural America had never seen a large city, let alone a giant Ferris Wheel or the the myriad other technical, commercial and architectural wonders on display.<br />Larson's other story is H. H. Holmes, who may have been America's first serial mass murderer.  As Larson points out, nobody knows for certain how many victims Holmes may have claimed, because in late 19th century Chicago, disappearances were astonishingly common, and, for the most part, the police were both overworked and incurious.<br />To modern eyes, Holmes appears a classic and obvious type, a charmer who literally seduced many of his victims before dispatching them. But the remarkable part of his story is how easily Holmes, with his façade of concern and good manners,  evaded detection for so long, even as the disappearances piled up around him.  The story of his crime spree, eventual capture and conviction could easily have been worthy of an entire separate book, and Larson makes a clear case for how the social milieu of Chicago allowed Holmes to operate undetected for so long.vasive media, that as recently as 1893, many people in rural America had never seen a large city, let alone a giant Ferris Wheel or the the myriad other technical, commercial and architectural wonders on display. <br />Larson's other story is H.

US	17602165	R2NJEGBK5CDKPA	0553572997	501395694	The Alienist	Books	4	0	0	false	false	Satisfying	The finest writing, to my mind, is that which uses one's mind.  Caleb Carr fully engages the minds of his readers by expertly plumbing the minds of his characters, including a chillingly twisted mind, that of a serial killer. Mr Carr invites his readers to sort out details, to route out clues, to struggle along with the protagonist, New York Times writer John Moore, as he devises a method in which to trap a man who has killed, and who will kill again, before captured finally within the breathless climax.  To capture this killer, John Moore utilises psychology, a science which in 1896, the year this novel transpires, was brand new, untried, and popularly maligned.  To help him along in this is Laszlo Kreizler, the Alienist, a practitioner of psychology during a time when the mind remained the domain of myth, misunderstanding, and the property of a Higher Power.  Battling corruption and ignorance, John Moore, under Kreizler's tutelage, rallies an investigation that plows new ground in crime fighting history.  These men are splendid and admirably portrayed, however, I admired especially the female liason, if simply for the fact that Mr Carr included an intelligent, independent woman character within a late 19th-century setting, a time almost universally unkind toward women, wherein they were relegated to the lower ranks, and regrettably dismissed to forgettable subservient roles.	2004-06-21

It comes on page 488, in figure 18-7, where we are trying to calculate which security problems are most important to fix. &quot;Cost to fix&quot; and &quot;difficulty to fix&quot; should _subtract_ from the total score for a problem, not add to it, since the more expensive or difficult a problem is to fix, the _less_ likely it makes economic sense to fix it. That an error as fundamental as this could slip by shows how poorly this book was edited.<br />All in all, this is a disastrously bad book. To some degree, too many cooks have spoiled the soup (the book has several co-authors, and they seem not to have read each others' contributions). There's an immense amount of duplication of material, while at the same time there are many terms and concepts that are invoked without ever being defined. At the least, this book should state that a reader needs a casual familiarity with networking (equivalent to that required by the Network+ exam, which I passed) to have any hope of understanding a good 40% of the book's material.<br />The only valuable chapters are the ones on security baselines  (specifically the info on operating system and application hardening), cryptography (though much of the math used there is not explained), and public key infrastructures--conveniently, these are chapters 9 through 11.<br />Though this is the only Security+ book I have read, I feel confident in recommending any other book over it.	2004-06-21

It did not disappoint, but competition is tough and others do a better job in some areas.<br />My biggest complaint would be a poor map of Tokyo subway (black and white, coding of lines difficult to follow even for someone who is not a complete newcomer), even poorer street map of Tokyo itself and no subway map for Kyoto. True, you can get free subway maps; and decent maps of Tokyo are available separately, but after investing money into a good guide you should not have to worry about this.<br />The guide sounds inspired and cheerful, sections about dining, culture and the language are better than adequate. It can be quite prescriptive at times, but it does not really stand in the way of enjoyment.<br />The guide does a good job countering small-minded myths about &quot;expensive Japan&quot;. To all those whining about $10 cups of coffee and $100 melons I say this: if coffee and melons and other comforts are so crucial to you, maybe you should stay at home to make sure you have cheap supply of these commodities. One recalls certain Lonely Planet writers who dedicate half of their time spent in Scandinavia to a search for cheap booze; they get very disappointed when they cannot find any and then they go on for pages and pages about it. Well, Fodor's guide does not get its foot into the same trap: when in Japan, do not try to recreate home experiences and you'll be fine. Still, I think the guide worries too much about Italian and Mexican restaurants in Japan: I do not think there are many people so strange that they would go half-way around the world and then try to get something that is available back home for a fraction of a price. Anyway, looking for an italian place in Japan is a bit like shopping for a computer in Ghana - yes, it is available, but why would you do it?<br />The guide is strong on directions to the attractions and descriptions are brief but accurate. I liked Hokkaido section which not all guidescover adequately (DK Eyewitness, for example, only managed to cough up a few pages - definitely not sufficient for the exciting land that is the north of Japan).<br />It is disappointing that Fodor decided not to cover Okinawa at all: many of travellers to Japan would want to go there. I understand this was done because they needed more space for Tokyo and Kyoto.<br />It is evident that the writers do not have the same fascination with Tokyo as they have with Kyoto. It is not a shortcoming because no-one really loves both the same way, yet you may find that Rough Guide does a more spirited coverage of the main city.<br />Overall, DK Eyewitness has much better maps (not so strong on anything else, unfortunately), Lonely Planet has solid descriptions and practical info of some more remote places and also covers kanji versions of placenames in a very convenient way, but overall Rough Guide Japan is still the strongest book for the destination (and I am not a natural fan of Rough Guide, but in Japan they really surpassed themselves and all others). <br />Fodor's Japan is good but not ideal unless you like their writing style and their indexing system (admittedly quite good, and goes some way towards compensating for less-than-adequate mapping) so much that you are prepared to ignore the shortcomings.	2004-06-21

That was one of the reasons why I read this one as he caught my interest by the great details of every point on his trip. Masked Rider was the same. He must have kept a great journal to be able to detail every point and feeling on his ride. A lot of the book was soul searching for him as well as trying to figure out his ride companions. It was a book that couldn't be put down as I ride bikes too and could envision everything he was talking about. I would give the book 5 stars if it was not for my next point.<BR>As we all know Rush have been around for 30 years now and have sold millions of albums. I too, am one of their biggest fans. However, I could not get over the fact of how cheap Peart is!! From the fact that he turned his back on the woman on the train who was robbed, to standing back and watching vendors at the market so he could see what a fair price for merchandise was going for, or taking advantage of a kid to get his bike washed for $1.00, to living in the poorest conditions at hotels so the tour guide Dave wouldn't stretch his budget. I realize the tour was paid for in advance by each member, but could he not kick in a few bucks to make this an enjoyable ride, even if they were going to experience the whole thing, hardships and all? Also I don't think he ever let anyone in his group know who he \\"was\\". And did they pick up his book years later only to find it was them he was tearing apart? I'm sorry, but I found the same thing running in Ghost Rider. This did not keep me from reading an otherwise excellent book. Maybe the next trip he goes on he should not only dig down deep to soul search, but maybe dig down deeper in his pockets too!!	2004-06-21

Do we really think that Big Business, left to its own devices, would not let a tragedy such as the Triangle fire happen again?<br />Von Drehle goes beyond just giving us a blow-by-blow account of how the fire happened.  He shows why the fire had the impact it had by putting it in the larger context of labor relations &amp; the political climate of New York City.  A significant 1909 strike by shirtwaist makers, combined with a shift in power within the Tammany Machine, made it possible for real steps in reform to be made in the next decade.  Of course, it was the horrifying nature of the Triangle fire that provided the impetus for change, but if it had happened 10 years earlier, it is hard to see that it would have had the impact that it did.<br />Von Drehle does a good job combining s journalist's narrative skill with historian's perspective, something that is not that easy to do.  It would have been easy enough simply to focus on the only the fire &amp; the subsequent trial, but the historian in von Drehle understands that the Triangle fire is only important when understood in the larger context.<br />Everyone who has ever held a job should read this book to get a real sense of perspective.  Anyone who spends a lot of time extolling the virtues of free enterprise might consider that this book portrays free enterprise taken to its logical extremes, with fatal &amp; horrifying results.  Theoretrically, unrestrained free enterprise may seem fine and dandy, but we have seen the reality of it --- this book chronicles just a small portion of that reality.	2004-06-21

I will never look at Cinderella the same way again.  This book doesn't just retell the story from another point of view, it does so by creating characters you connect with and pulling you into the story so much that you forget it's the same old fairy tale.  I admit it's a little slow in the beginning, and it took me a few chapters to get totally into it, but once I did, I couldn't put it down.  I expected this to be one of those stories where the Stepsister tells her side of the story, putting all the blame on Cinderella, but what I found was a truly moving story where there isn't a real villain, just three sisters who are all products of a dysfunctional family.  <br />I seriously reccomend this book to anyone who is looking for a good read.	2004-06-21

Other authors may have excelled in the detective story, but it was G.K. Chesterton who elevated it to a higher intellectual and literary level. His writing combines wit, humor and whimsy with deep insights into psychology, philosophy, and even theology. While others viewed the detective story as a mere entertaining puzzle, G.K. treated it as a serious art form, with potential for symbolism and allegory. Father Brown is one of the classic fictional detectives of all time, a character more &quot;real&quot; than many living people. How wonderful to have all the Father Brown stories under one cover! Keep this volume by your bedside or near your favorite armchair, so you can dip into it on a rainy weekend, before you go to bed, or at any time you like. All confirmed Father Brown devotees must have the Penguin COMPLETE FATHER BROWN, and those who have not yet discovered this detective genius could find no better way to become acquainted with him.	2004-06-21

This is my first purchase from the Cambridge Music Handbooks series and I'm very impressed. It's been a while since I've gleaned so much from such a brief read. First of all, the author treats the poetry with refreshing seriousness. If you've ever been put off by the apparent insipidity of Mueller's poetry, this may be the book to change your mind. Most of the musical analysis has to with the text-music relationship, which heightens appreciation for the poet and composer alike. I certainly came away with a much more confident sense of the drama and unity of the cycle. Highly recommended. If you are a musician tackling the song cycle for the first time, I would almost say it is indispensible.	2004-06-21

That is because while the book is written by Dr. Seuss it features the jolly drawings of the English artist Quentin Blake.  Until this point every time I have read a book written by Dr. Seuss it was also illustrated by Dr. Seuss and when somebody else did the drawings Dr. Seuss used the name Theo. LeSieg (which is &quot;Geisel&quot; backwards).  So the fact that this is a real &quot;Dr. Seuss&quot; book drawn by somebody else is pretty special.<br />This Bright and Early Book provides rhymed text and illustrations introducing the many meanings of the word &quot;up&quot; as Seuss and Blake show beginning readers that this is a &quot;Great day for up!&quot;  You get the point half way through the book but little kids should be able to hand on longer, especially when they are reading the book for themselves.  Besides, by the end of &quot;Great Day for Up&quot; we get to the point where &quot;EVERYONE on Earth is up!&quot; (with one very important and rather ironic exception).<br />As with all of the Bright and Early Books for Beginning Beginners what you have here is a brief and funny story, where the words are few and easy, there is a catchy rhythm, and the pictures are happy and colorful clues to the text.  These are designed for an even lower age group than the Bright and Early Books that followed &quot;The Cat in the Hat,&quot; which was the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; of its day when it came to encouraging even pre-schoolers to discover the delights of reading for themselves.  This is not one of the most interesting volumes in the series, but overall these books were a delight.	2004-06-21

There are a number of reviewers who proclaim that the language agnostic nature of this book, in addition to it's erudite tone, more than compensate for the (artificial) learning curve. <br />I beg to differ. Being an actuary, I recognize that this book's code snippets are written in a variation of APL. APL is hardly a self-evident programming language (read-only is a more accurate description).<br />While computer science cognoscenti might decry spoon-feeding, there's nothing wrong with being *concise and clear* concurrently. Indeed, the truly great books in the hard sciences are both easy to read and rigorous at the same time. If pedants would get off of their high horses for a moment, they would probably admit this much (heck, who wouldn't?).<br />Rigor at the expense of clarity may appeal to intellectual snobs (who live for the material, god help them), and clarity at the expense of rigor may appeal to beginners, but WHY NOT HAVE BOTH?<br />While this book covers a good deal of ground, it does so at the expense of clarity. A canonical book would have both rigor and clarity, and this book doesn't. It's as simple as that.  <br />The sordid truth about this book is that Professors tend to assign it as reading material with the expectation that students will rely primarily on class notes and then use the book as a reference of sorts (or as a source of homework problems). Most of the graduate courses that I've taken follow this approach.<br />Having said all this, academia is essentially a small and sterile refuge for people who couldn't hack the real world. Take your courses, if you must, and then go out and get a life. In the end, most journals end up in the waste basket. Your time on this planet is short, don't waste it cloistered in a library!<br />trust me on this...	2004-06-21

But maps at the rental car counter are much better.  I had hoped to get a map prior to my trip so I could study and be familiar with the island.  Maps on the Internet are woefully lacking.  But, at least, those are free.  What I essentially got with this was a folding placemat.  Names of many streets, towns, etc. were not on the map and vice versa.  We took a drive to the north side of the island and were on a road that this map didn't even acknowledge.  Ibiza is a small island.  How could you not get all of the roads? Compound that with mis-spellings and you are wasting your money.  Unfortunately, I couldn't give fewer than a one star rating here.  Avoid this map at all costs.	2004-06-21

What happens when it mixes with American culture?  In Kali Plomin's &quot;Before the Monsoon&quot; we meet India-born Vijay Dalvi as he comes of age while living with his relatives in Chicago.  Vijay is at a crossroads in his life.  Will he return to India to help with the family factory?  Or should he stay and carve out his path in America?  Will he agree to an arranged marriage or find someone on his own?  Vijay struggles with indecision and disappointment but also finds humor in his daily interacions.  Plomin paints a vibrant picture of life for Indian Americans--especially the younger generation--as they negotiate life that mixes two cultures.

I think there could have been more common words chosen for the first 100 words a person learns in the language, but the book is good at teaching your brain how to commit these words to memory with flashcards and exercises where you match the phonetic, English, and Farsi form of the word.  For anyone who is going to take a course in Farsi, I would definitely recommend this book as a pre-course, get your feet wet, kind of study aid.  It takes a fun approach to learning the language and you'll feel a lot better starting a course with some words and the alphabet already under your belt.  For those of you doing self-study or looking to travel, you will not find use for this book.  This book has you learn words, not phrases and you'll likely be disappointed.  But if you are looking to get a headstart on a course or just deciding whether you want to learn Farsi, this is a good place to start.	2004-06-21

The author gets the details right, but does not obsess over the grade of lead in the bullets, or the chemical composition of the propellants.  Instead, he takes the swirling Battle of Kursk, millions of men and thousands of machines, and pulls it into focus as the ancient tale of a single man facing an immortal monster.  <br />Leathery old Dimitri is armored with little more than his Kazak honor, and his T-34 seems like cardboard against Hitler's latest superweapon, the massive Tiger tank.  This is classic stuff disguised as hot-running fiction.  Author David L. Robbins is not out to take Tom Clancy's lunch, he's trying to catch Hemingway and Steinbeck.  The Battle of Hill 260.8 will make you stand up and cheer, and the Award of the Order of Buttons is a most perfect recognition of battle honors.  These two scenes combine into one of the most powerful passages ever written, in any language.	2004-06-21

It is well-written and easily accessible for someone wanting to learn about how these entities interact.  The perspective on Alan Greenspan is interesting and left me wanting to learn more.  It would also be helpful for anyone interested in learning about the stock market or bond market as Greenspan has had such a dramatic effect in both these areas.	2004-06-21

Radenko Fanuka has written a book, Reflections:  Personalizing Life, Nature, Man and God, that is unique in almost every way.  Most books are about stories, real, or imagined, that seize the reader's interest until the final chapter, or epilogue, when the outcome is at last disclosed.  Other books are written for the express purpose of helping the reader in very specific ways.  These books fall into the &quot;How to&quot; category, where the range of topics, and subjects has truly become endless.  They include such diverse categories as health, finance, gardening, home decorations, sports, hobbies, etc.  They serve their purpose well because they provide their readers with the information and directions they seek.<BR> Mr. Fanuka's book has no such purpose in mind.  Thankfully so, otherwise, it would fall into the same big basket of books available to readers at any good book store, or public library.  What Mr. Fanuka has done, is something very different, very special, very valuable, and extremely insightful.  He has chosen to share major character forming experiences that took place in his life as he grew up on a rural farm in Croatia.  He also included those experiences which greatly affected his life from the time he moved to America in 1962 until the present day.<BR> In essence, his book is a series of short essays which revolve around a variety of everyday subjects, people, animals, birds, morals, ethics, and feelings.  In each essay, we are asked to think and reflect in ways we never do during the course of our everyday lives.  Thankfully Mr. Fanuka constantly reminds us of the simple beauty, glory, and joy of nature and all living things that inhabit it, especially people.<BR> I cannot recall, or imagine an author who writes about animals, birds, plants and even insects in such descriptive terms which show their place and value in the grand scheme of life.  Mr. Fanuka accomplishes this task because he has lived it, believes in it, and has used it to shape andguide his life and dealings with family and friends alike.  His main theme in the book and in his personal life is, truth in all things, with nature serving as his guiding light.  A poet once wrote, &quot;Truth is beauty, beauty is truth.&quot;  How fittingly this describes Mr. Fanuka's simple philosophy about how life should be lived by all people.<BR> Answer this question objectively and honestly.  How many of us truly take the time or spend the energy to faithfully carry out the commandment, &quot;Honor your Father and your Mother?&quot;  Again, Mr. Fanuka leads and guides us through his own personal care and devotion to and reflections about his parents.  It is a constant source of strength and pride throughout the book.<BR> Unfortunately, our lives are here and gone at such a rapid pace that we often don't<BR> devote our time, energy and efforts on those who brought us into this world, cared for us, protected us, and guided our lives toward productive ends.  To read and understand how Mr. Fanuka accomplished this greatest of all commandments is to realize and appreciate the meaning of only one of the many messages the author conveys.  The list of lessons is long and vital, yet there is one more that I wish to include in this review.<BR> People who were born here in America, as I was, can never fully comprehend, or appreciate what freedom really means.  Yes, we mumble the usual platitudes about freedom, and how sacred it is to us, but we can never fully understand the value of such a blessing when we have never been without it since birth.  Can a person ever truly appreciate water or food when he/she has never once been thirsty or hungry?  Obviously, the answer is no, and the same can be said about freedom.<BR> America, its freedoms, values and way of life, is a constantly recurring theme in the book, and it is not by accident, but by design and appreciation.  Indeed, the terrible events of 9/11 are a source of deep, traumatic and sad reflection by the author.This theme surfaces in several of his essays.  It is thus his hope and prayer that our suffering as individuals, families, and as a nation can be sustained and eventually overcome by our devotion to the ideas, ideals, and loving spirit that have made us the freest, kindest and greatest nation in the history of mankind.	2004-06-21

Dick novel, and in my opinion \\"Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said\\" deserves high praise. For starters, it wins the fight against one of the most difficult opponents that a sci-fi novel could face: Clich&eacute;. Simply put, this story is based on an overused plot-the man who loses his identity and struggles to regain a sense of self. Cliche is a tough monster to beat, and most sci-fi novels are devoured by it boots and all. Going into this novel (which I read on a recommendation from a friend) I had low expectations, because I for one am sick to death of this particular premise. However, Phillip Dick somehow managed to actually win the battle against this tired fiction formula, and won me over in the process. He actually found, somehow, a unique way of telling the story. A very unique way.<br />It deserves kudos for this alone. Not the snack, but the regard and esteem.<br />Apart from being pleasantly surprised at Dick's ability to pull this story off, there is a lot more that deserves commendation, too... there's a like-him-hate-him anti hero, a wonderfully fleshed-out policeman (two, actually), and a manically bizarre \\"mini-heroine\\" that pops up to simultaneously help, hurt and hinder the protagonist, Jason Taverner.<br />Another aspect of the book that I enjoyed was Dick's writing style. The story is written upon a fine line between poetry and prose that often lulled me into a false sense of security. He managed on several occasions to make me say \\"wow\\" due to some particularly inspiring turn of phrase, or through some witty and poignant philosophical observation... in fact, some of his descriptions, in their poetic simplicity, created such vivid images in my mind that I am inclined to compare them to Bradbury's classic Fahrenheit 451, which contains one of my favorite pieces of descriptive text of all time.<br />All-in-all, \\"Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said\\" is an easy read with very realistic characters, a healthy dose of political and philosophical impact (which is what sci-fi is all about after all), a delightful plot-twist at the ending (I loved the ending), and an overall quality and completeness that many novels lack. The ending (did I mention that I loved the ending) was ripe with potentialities as well, an amalgam of hidden possibilities and quantum probabilities. Basically, the premise of the book (that a man is sucked into some alternate reality where he does not exist) is caused by something that does not fully cease to occur until somewhere in the epilogue (That will make more sense after you read the book. Pay attention at the end, and wonder just what is real and what isn't. It's fun).philosophical impact (which is what sci-fi is all about after all), a delightful plot-twist at the ending (I loved the ending), and an overall quality and completeness that many novels lack.
